The svrsymbols package is a LaTeX interface to the SVRsymbols
font. The glyphs of this font are ideograms that have been 
designed for use in Physics texts. Some symbols are standard and 
some are entirely new. In version 2.0a of the package, we added
many new and old symbols.

In version 2.0b we added an OpenType font for those people who prefer
to use LibreOffice or MS-Office.
