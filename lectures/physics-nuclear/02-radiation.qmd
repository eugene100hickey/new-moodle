## Nucleus emits an $\alpha$ particle

-   loses two protons and two neutrons
-   Z decreases by 2 and A decreases by 4
    -   $^A_ZParent\;=>\;^{A-4}_{Z-2}Daughter\;+\;\alpha$
-   examples
    -   $^{238}_{92}U\;=>\;^{234}_{90}Th\;+\;\alpha$
    -   $^{210}_{84}Po\;=>\;^{206}_{82}Pb\;+\;\alpha$

## Nucleus emits a $\beta$ particle

<br>

-   neutron in the nucleus splits into a proton and an electron
-   electron emitted as a beta particle
-   Z increases by 1 and A remains the same
    -   $^A_DP\;=>\;^{A}_{Z+1}D\;+\;\beta^- \; + \; \bar{\nu}$
-   examples
    -   $^{99}_{42}Mo\;=>\;^{99}_{43}Tc\;+\;\beta^- \; + \; \bar{\nu}$
    -   $^{14}_{6}C\;=>\;^{14}_{7}N\;+\;\beta^- \; + \; \bar{\nu}$

## Nucleus emits an $\gamma$ ray

<br>

-   no change in A, Z, just loss of excess energy from nucleus

## $\alpha$ decay

- $\alpha$ decay is caused by Coulomb Repulsion between protons

    - binding energy increase as **A**
    
    - Coulomb repulsion increases as **$Z^2$**
    
    - heavy nuclei want to offload some nucleons
    
    - energetically, emitting a single proton or neutron  or some lighter nuclei (e.g. $^3_1H$) not possible
    
        - but $^4_2He$ unusually stable
    
##

### Energy in $\alpha$ Decay

- energy released given by the differences in rest masses

    - $Q \; = (M_{parent} \; - \; M_{daughter} \; - \; M_{\alpha}) \times c^2$
    
    - or, in terms of binding energy:
    
        - $Q \; = \; A_{daughter} BE_{daughter}  + 4BE_{\alpha}-  A_{parent} BE_{parent}$
    
    - typical figures of about 4MeV
    
        - this is much less than particle rest mass energies
        
        - so non-relativistic

## 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}

## $\alpha$ particle energy release from $^{226}Ra$ to $^{222}Rn$

- $^{226}Ra \; mass  \; = \; 226.0253 \; g/mol$

- $^{222}Rn \; mass  \; = \; 222.0175 \; g/mol$

- $^{4}He \; mass  \; = \; 4.002604 \; g/mol$

- $(226.0253 - 222.0175 - 4.002604) \times (1.660539\times10^{-27}) \times c^2/1.60218\times 10^{-19}$ 

= $\; 4.84MeV$

- compares to experimental value of 4.78MeV

:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}

## Using Binding Energies

- $^{226}Ra \; BE  \; = \; 7.6620 \; MeV/nucleon$

- $^{222}Rn \; BE  \; = \; 7.6945 \; MeV/nucleon$

- $^{4}He \; BE  \; = \; 7.0739 \; MeV/nucleon$

- $(7.6945 \times 222 + 7.0739 \times 4 - 7.6620 \times 228) = 4.87MeV$

:::


## 

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}

### How is this energy shared between  $\alpha$ and Daughter Nucleus - Momentum Conservation

- total energy released is $Q \; = (M_{parent} \; - \; M_{daughter} \; - \; M_{\alpha}) \times c^2$

- this is equal to the kinetic enegies, T,  of the daughter nucleus and the $\alpha$

- assume parent nucleus at rest, so for momentum $p_{daughter} \; = \; p_{\alpha}$

- as these are non-relativistic, we can use Kinetic Energy = $\frac{p^2}{2m}$

- get $Q \; = T_{\alpha} \; + \; T_d \; = \; \frac{p_{\alpha}^2}{2m_{\alpha}} \; + \; \frac{p_d^2}{2m_d} \; = \; p_{\alpha}^2(\frac{1}{2m_{\alpha}} + \frac{1}{m_d})$

- get $T_{\alpha} = \frac{Q}{(1+\frac{m_{\alpha}}{m_d})} \approx \; Q(1 - \frac{m_{\alpha}}{m_d})$

- for 4MeV $\alpha$ decays, daughter nucleus gets about 100keV.

    - enough to escape surface of material
    
:::

##

### Relation between Half-Lives and $\alpha$ energies

- $\alpha$'s with high energies come from nuclei with short half-lives

    - note how adding neutrons stabilises nucleus

## $\beta$ Decay

- actually three types of $\beta$ decay

    - negative $\beta$ decay: $n \rightarrow p \; + \; e^-$ $\beta^-$
    
    - negative $\beta$ decay: $p \rightarrow n \; + \; e^+$ $\beta^+$
    
    - orbital electron capture: $p \; + \; e^-$ \rightarrow n$ $\epsilon$

- $\beta$ decay is via the *weak force*, because of this the half lives tend to be quite long.
    
##

### Neutrinos

- the reactions above are missing something

    - protons, electrons, and neutrons are all spin 1/2. 
    
    - also find spectrum of energy for the emitted $\beta$ particles
    
- answer is the neutrino

   - $\beta$ decay: $n \rightarrow p \; + \; e^- \; + \; \bar{\nu}$ 
   
## 

### Neutrinos

-   vaste numbers produced in the Sun
    -   1 trillion solar $\nu$'s pass through you every second
    -   you'll only absorb one in your lifetime
-   really hard to detect
    -   take an old gold mine in South Dakota
    -   fill it with cleaning fluid
    -   wait
    -   about once a day get $\nu _{e}+\ ^{37}Cl\longrightarrow \ ^{37}Ar^{+}+e^{-}$

## 

### Neutrinos

-   following on from Homestake, other neutrino observatories such as:
    -   SuperKamiokande in Japan
    -   Sudbury (SNO) in Ontario
    -   IceCube at the South Pole (literally) - $1km^3$
-   in February 1987, sudden burst of $\nu$'s detected at various neutrino observatories
    -   several hours later, light from a supernova in a nearby galaxy reached Earth
    -   first time we'd seen this
 
## Sources of Radiation

### $\alpha$ particles

-   almost all $\alpha$ particles originate in the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei e.g. $^{238}U$, $^{226}Ra$, etc.
-   $^{208}Pb$ is the heaviest stable nucleus known.
-   typically $\alpha$ energy of 4MeV ($6.4 \times 10^{-13}$ Joules)
-   \~highest is: $^{212}_{84}Po\; \rightarrow \; ^{208}_{82}Pb \;+\; \alpha\;+\;8.78MeV$

## 

### $\beta$ particles

-   naturally occuring sources of beta particles are rare.
-   often occur subsequent to nuclear fission.\
-   They can be prepared by irradiating target nuclei with neutrons ( e.g. $^{125}I$ for thryoid treatments ).
-   The beta emitter $^{14}C$ is produced by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere
-   bigger range of energies than $\alpha$ particles
    -   3.5MeV for $^{137}_{54}Xe \; \rightarrow \; ^{137}_{55}Cs \;+ \; \beta \; + \; \nu$
    -   18keV for $^{3}_{1}T \; \rightarrow \; ^{3}_{2}He \;+ \; \beta \; + \; \nu$

## 

### $\gamma$ rays

<br>

-   after $\alpha$ or $\beta$ decay, the daughter nucleus contains excess energy.
-   This is liberated by the release of a $\gamma$ ray
-   about 100keV typical energy

## Decay Series

- $\alpha$ decay changes nuclear mass by 4 units, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ don't change it at all. Means there are 4 *families* of nuclei.

## Radiation Safety

-   radiation damages tissue
    -   produces reactive chemicals (radicals) in the body
-   $\alpha$ particles are the most dangerous, considered 20 times more dangerous than $\beta$'s
    -   because they all their energy in a smaller volume
-   $\gamma$ rays are more difficult to control because of their greater penetration

## Radon

-   large dose of radiation due to the build up of radon in houses
-   radon decays to polonium, bismuth, etc. These latch onto dust particles and can be absorbed by the lungs. They emit a cascade of alpha particles
-   20,000 deaths (lung cancer) per year in the USA due to radon

## 

-   radon dose determined by:
    -   amount of uranium in underlying rocks
    -   permeability of topsoil
    -   cracks and fissures in floor
    -   ventilation in house
-   buildings from 1980's on
    -   fine, contain impermeable plastic layer in foundations
-   buildings from before 1950's
    -   fine, because so draughty

## Radioactive Decay Laws

-   decay of individual nucleus is a totally random process, occurs with certain probability in a certain time period
-   for large numbers of nuclei can use statistics
-   rate of disintegrations from a nuclear source is proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei present

## 

::: callout-tip
## Mathematics of Radioactive exponential decay

-   $-\frac{dN}{dt}\;\alpha\;N$
-   $-\frac{dN}{dt}\;=\;\lambda\;N$
-   $N\;=\;N_0e^{-\lambda t}$
:::

-   where N is the number of radioactive nuclei present at a particular time
-   $-\frac{dN}{dt}$ is the rate of decrease in N.
-   $N_o$ is the original number of nuclei present.
-   $\lambda$ is called the radioactive decay constant and depends on the nature of the nucleus

## Radioactive Half Life, $t_{1/2}$

<br>

-   a convenient way of discribing radioactive decay is in terms of the radioactive half life, $t_{1/2}$ .
-   the half life is defined as the time taken for the number of radioactive nuclei present in a source to fall to half it’s original value.
-   half lives of naturally occurring radioisotopes vary over a wide range
    -   $3 \times 10^{-7}$s ($^{212}Po$) to $1.4 \times 10^{10}$years ($^{232}Th$)

## 

<br> <br> <br>

::: callout-tip
## the half life is related to the decay constant by:

-   $t_{1/2}\;=\;\frac{log_e2}{\lambda}\;=\;\frac{0.693}{\lambda}$

## Measurement of Radiation

### Activity

-   This is the number of disintegrations occurring per second.
-   It is easily measured with a Geiger counter.
-   This activity is proportional to the number of radioactive atoms in the sample.\
-   $Activity\;=\; -\frac{dN}{dt}\; =\;\lambda N$

## 

### The units of activity are:

-   Curie (Ci)
    -   $1\;Ci\; =\; 3.7 \times10^{10}\; disintegrations/sec$
    -   A clinical source of $^{60}Co$ has an activity of several Ci
    -   An internally administered dose for cancer treatment would have an activity of $10^{-3}$ Ci
-   Becquerel (Bq)
    -   1 Bq = 1.0 disintegrations /sec
    -   This is the SI. unit (1 Ci = $3.7 \times 10^{10}$ Bq)

## Absorbed Dose

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   This is the effect of the radiation on the absorbing material
-   The SI unit for absorbed dose is the gray (Gy) which is the amount of radiation which deposits energy at a rate of 1 J / kg in any absorbing material.
    -   (The old unit was the rad ... 1 Gy = 100 rad)
-   The absorbed dose depends on
    1.  the strength of a given radiation beam (number of particles per second)
    2.  the energy per particle but also on the type of material absorbing the radiation
:::

## 

-   This is not the most meaningful units for measuring the biological damage produced by radiation.
-   This is because equal doses of different types of radiation cause differing amounts of damage (1 gray of $\alpha$ particles produces 10 to 20 times the damage of 1 gray of $\beta$ particles or $\gamma$ rays)
-   This is because the $\alpha$ particles move more slowly than $\beta$ and $\gamma$ rays of equal energy due to their greater mass and ionising collisions occur closer together resulting in more irreparable damage

## 

-   The ***relative biological effectiveness (RBE)*** or quality factor (QF) of a given type of radiation is defined as the number of grays of X-ray or $\gamma$ radiation that produces the same biological damage as 1 gray of the given radiation.
-   The product of the dose in grays and the QF gives a unit of sieverts (previously rem)
-   1 sievert of any type of radiation does the same approximate biological damage
    -   Radioactive background 1.3 mSv /year
    -   X-rays 0.7 mSv / year

## Exposure Limits

-   5 mSv per year exposure to the general population
-   50 mSv per year to nuclear workers
-   A 4 Sv dose in a short interval of time is fatal with 50% of cases but when spread over a few weeks it is not usually fatal.
-   A 10 Sv dose is nearly always fatal

## Principle sources of radiation

-   Radon - 1mSv per year
-   CT scans - 0.8mSv per year
-   Nuclear Medcine - 0.4mSv per year
-   Cosmic Rays - 0.15mSv per year
-   internal radiation (mostly potassium, $^{40}K$) 0.03mSv per year
-   get total of about $10\mu Sv$ per day. Below legal limit.

## Equations

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   $N\;=\;N_0e^{-\lambda t}$

-   $t_{1/2}\;=\;\frac{log_e2}{\lambda}\;=\;\frac{0.693}{\lambda}$

-   $Bq = Ci \times 3.7\times10^{10}$

-   $(energy\;in\;joules) = MeV \times 1.6\times 10^{-13}$

-   $Gray = \frac{Bq \times (energy\;in\;joules)}{(person\;mass\; in \;kg)}$

-   $Sv = \frac{Bq \times (energy\;in\;joules) \times RBE }{(person\;mass\; in \;kg)}$

-   $(expected\;number\; of\; deaths) = \frac{(dose\; in\; Sievert) \times (population)}{50}$

-   typical daily dose = 10$\mu$Sv.

-   $LD_{50 / 30}$ = 4Sv
