## Summary

<br>

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
The stability of the nucleus relies on the short range nuclear force. The models produced can account for the nature and energy of radiation products, the results of scattering experiments, and the range of isotopes across the table of elements. We get a measure of stability, the *binding energy per nucleon* that peaks around iron. Lighter elements will look to fuse together (fusion) and heavier elements to split apart (fission). Makes a source of tremendous amounts of energy.

## Nuclear Fission

-   During Fission, a heavy isotope splits into two or more fragments , this binding energy is released during the process. Nuclear reactors and Atomic bombs make use of this. A typical reaction is $^1n\; +\; ^{235}U \rightarrow \;^{236}U \rightarrow \;^{141}Ba +\; ^{92}Kr +  3 ^1n$

-   Approximately 200 MeV of energy is released per fission

    -   B/A for $^{235}U$ = 7.59MeV, for $^{141}Ba$ = 8.8MeV, for $^{92}Kr$ = 7.83MeV

## 

-   During fission several neutrons are emitted by each nucleus and these cause further fission
    -   can cause a chain reaction
    -   reason for neutron emmission is to maintain proton/neutron ratio appropriate for atomic mass
    -   fission products tend to be $\beta$ emitters
-   number of neutrons (*k*) that propagate reaction is crucial
    -   if k \< 1 then reaction dies out
    -   if k \> 1 then explosion
    -   if k $\approx$ 1 then controlled power plant

## 

-   control rods made from **Cadmium** can be used to absorb neutrons, keep k close to 1

-   surface to volume ratio important

    -   critical mass (about 50kg for $^{235}U$)

-   Fission bomb types

    -   gun type (*Little Boy* dropped on Hiroshima)
    -   implosion type (*Fat Man* dropped on Nagasaki)

-   The large numbers of neutrons produced in a reactor can be used to produce nuclear transformations in suitable elements producing radioisotopes for therapy, tracing etc.

## Neutrons in Fission

-   absorbtion of neutron is what triggers fission

-   $^{235}U$ is even-odd, $^{236}U$ is even-even

    -   lots of energy released into nucleus which bubbles inside before splitting it apart

-   neutron absorbtion is much more probable for *slow* (thermal, \~10eV) neutrons

    -   but neutrons emitted in fission are hot (\~MeV)
    -   slow down by collisions with light nuclei
    -   ***moderator***, usually water (contains $^1H^+$) or graphite carbon

## Fission Reactors

-   natural Uranium is about 1% $^{235}U$ (mostly $^{238}U$)

-   reactor grade is about 20% $^{235}U$

-   weapons grade is about 85% $^{235}U$

-   $^{239}Pu$ also fissionable

## 4<sup>th</sup> Generation Reactors - SMR

-   small and modular can be transported by road

-   higher temperatures so more efficient

-   liquid salt coolant (Natrium type) can act as energy reservoir

-   continuous fuel feed so no need to shut down to service

-   $^{238}U$ act as neutron absorber to control reaction rates

-   build on sites of old coal plants

-   cost about €3B, take \~ 10 years

-   typically 80-300MW per reactor

## Fusion Reactors

-   use $^{3}T$ or $^{2}D$ (tritium or deuterium)

    -   $^{2}D$ naturally occuring (1 in 6,500 water molecules)

    -   $^{3}T$ is not, 12 year half-life

-   need temperatures of about 150 million $^{\circ} C$

    -   laser induced fusion (pulse of 2 MJ)

    -   magnetic confinement (20T) in a **Tokamak** (doughnut shape)

-   Large science effort, current leaders are Lawrence Livermore in California (laser) and ITER in Cadarache in France (tokomak)
