## Summary

<br>

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
The nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. The stability of the nucleus relies on the short range nuclear force. The models produced can account for the nature and energy of radiation products, the results of scattering experiments, and the range of isotopes across the table of elements. We get a measure of stability, the *binding energy per nucleon* that peaks around iron.

The natural distance scale for the nucleus is the femtometre (1 fm = $10^{-15}m$), the natural energy or mass unit is the mega electron volt ($1MeV = 1.6 \times 10^{-13}J = 1.78 \times 10^{-30}kg$)

2.  Nuclear Sizes and Shapes
3.  The Nuclear Force
4.  Nuclear Masses and Binding Energies

## Nuclear Constituents

-   Nuclei consist of *protons* and *neutrons*

    -   these have almost exactly the same mass
    -   neutrons a little heavier, but by less than 0.2%

-   masses of nuclei are very nearly integers (when measured in amu)

-   intrinsic spin (and thus magnetic moment) of nucleus consistent with both neutrons and protons have spin $\frac{1}{2}$

## Notation

::: callout-note
## Syntax

-   Atomic Number ( Z ) is the number of protons in the nucleus.

-   Atomic Mass ( A ) is the combined number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.

-   Also, N is the number of neutrons, but we use that less often

$^A_ZElement\;e.g.\;^4_2He\;has\; A=4\; and\; Z=2\; (sometimes\; just\;^4He)$
:::

-   how many protons and neutrons in $^{226}_{88}Ra$ ?

-   ***Isotopes*** are nuclei with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons

    -   e.g. $^{226}_{82}Pb$, $^{226}_{82}Pb$, $^{226}_{82}Pb$, $^{226}_{82}Pb$

-   A solitary neutron isn't stable, decays with half-life of 878s (15 minutes)

    -   turns in to a proton and electron (and anti-neutrino)

-   Neutrons and protons aren't point particles (unlike the electron). Have radii of about 1fm.

    - made of _quarks_

## Measuring mass in mega-electron volts (MeV)

-   electron volts measure energy
    -   literally energy an electron gets when it crosses a 1 volt battery
    -   charge on electron is $1.6 \times 10^{-19}C$, so energy is $1eV = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}Joules$
-   from relativity, $mass \; \leftrightarrow \; energy$
-   using $E = m\times c^2$ thus $mass = energy\; /\;c^2$ and we get:
-   $1eV = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} /\; c^2 = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} /\; (3 \times 10^8)^2 = 1.78 \times 10^{-36} kg$
-   $1MeV =  10^{6}eV  = 1.78 \times 10^{-30} kg$
:::

Makes for a handy unit to measure nuclear energies and masses.


## Nuclear Size

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}

-   femtometer is natural unit for nucleus

    -   $1fm \; = \; 10^{-15}m$

-   nuclear radii range from 1fm to about 7fm

    -   very small compared to size of atom

-   measure using:

    -   electron diffraction
    -   isotope wavelength shifts
    -   Coulomb energies of mirror nuclei
    -   scattering of $\alpha$ particles
    -   $\alpha$ decay lifetimes

:::

## 

### Electron Diffraction

electrons have wavelengths given by:

$$\lambda \; = \; \frac{hc}{E}$$

diffraction minima at $$sin\theta \; = \; \frac{1.22 \times \lambda}{D}$$

420MeV electrons give minimum at $50.5^{\circ}$ for $^{12}_6C$

gives nuclear radius of 2.33fm

## 

### Isotope Wavelength Shifts

![From Krane - Introductory Nuclear Physics](images/isotope-shifts.png)

The larger the nucleus, the less chance the electron (or in diagram above, muon) has to be in close proximity to a high concentration of charge

##

### Mirror Nuclei

- mirror nuclei have opposite numbers of protons and neutrons

    - example $^3_1H$ and $^3_2He$
    
- as far as the nuclear force is concerned, there is no difference between protons and neutrons

- but the extra positive charge in $^3_2He$ carries a Coulomb penalty, which will depend on the average separation of the protons

- can measure this energy difference by the maximum energy of positron from $\beta$ decay


## Structure of Nucleus

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   must be something holding nucleus together, stopping positive protons flying apart

-   also need to explain radiation

    -   energies of $\alpha,\; \beta,\; \gamma$
    -   nuclear half lives

-   scattering experiments (fire particles at nucleus and see how they bounce off)

-   which nuclei are stable

-   behind all this is the ***Nuclear Force***, the left over remnants of the ***Strong Force***
:::

## Nuclear Force

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
Something has to hold the nucleus together. Some properties of this *nuclear force*

-   must be big, has to overcome Coulomb repulsion between protons

$E_{pp} \; = \; \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_\circ}\; \frac{e^2}{r}$ - this is about 1MeV for \~fm separation

-   only relevant at fm distances, feeble at greater separations (\>3fm)

-   only effects protons and neutrons, not electrons

    -   it's like electrons are nuclear force *neutral*

-   agnostic to difference between protons and neutrons

-   repulsive at short (\< 0.5fm) distances

-   depends on spins of nucleons
:::

## Nuclear Force

-   no analytic form of nuclear force

    -   nothing like Coulomb's Law or Einstein's gravity

$F_{Coulomb} \; = \; \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{\circ}} \; \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}\;\;$ or $\;\;{\displaystyle G_{\mu \nu }+\Lambda g_{\mu \nu }=\kappa T_{\mu \nu },}$

-   best modelled as an *exchange* force, mediated by some particle

-   first analysed by Yukawa

## Investigating Nuclear Force

-   can get a bound state of a single proton and a single neutron, called *deuteron* (c.f. deuterium, $^2H$)

-   don't get *proton-proton* or *neutron-neutron*

-   deuteron has the protons and neutron spins parallel ($l = 1$, triplet)

-   no excited states of deuteron

## 

### Nuclear Drop Model

-   nuclear densities pretty much all the same

    -   $Radius\;=\;1.2 \times \sqrt[3]{A}$ in fm

-   surface a little proton rich

-   but charge and matter radii of nucleu=i agree to within 0.1fm

-   shape roughly spherical, a little oblate. Usually.

## 

### Nuclear Shell Model

-   protons and neutrons moving in orbits within nucleus

-   energy levels akin to atomic electron energy levels

-   nuclei with evens numbers of protons and even numbers of neutrons most stable

    -   protons and neutrons fill up energy levels independently\
    -   of the 288 nuclei found in nature, 169 are even-even, only 8 are odd-odd
    -   $^{2}D$, $^{8}Li$, $^{10}B$, $^{14}N$, $^{40}K$, $^{50}V$, $^{138}La$, $^{176}Lu$

## 

-   electrostatic repulsion between protons isn't nothing

    -   they're only \~ 1fm apart
    -   preference for neutrons (no repulsion)
    -   light nuclei have Z \~ N (equal numbers)
    -   heavier nuclei have more neutrons than protons

-   set of magic numbers (a.k.a. noble elements)

    -   2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126
    -   lots of isotopes for these elements

## 

![Nuclear Valley of Stability (from wikipedia)](images/DecayModeNuDat2.png)

## $\alpha$ Decay

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   looking within a nucleus, we see temporary assemblages of $\alpha$ particles.

-   these aren't static, and collide up against the inner wall of the nucleus frequently

-   classically they don't have enough energy to escape, but can get out through quantum mechanical *tunnelling*

-   super sensitive to size of barrier, and the energy of this quasi-$alpha$ particle

    -   explains the extreme range of $\alpha$ half lives
    -   get correlation between half life and ejected $\alpha$ energy
:::


## Nuclear Binding Energy

-   nucleus is a little lighter than the sum of its parts

::: callout-note
## Binding Energy per Nucleon of $^{238}U$

-   mass of proton = 938.272 MeV
-   mass of neutron = 939.565 MeV
-   mass of $^{238}U$ = 221 743 MeV

$(938.272 \times 92 + 939.565 \times 146 - 221743) / 238 = 7.372\; MeV\; per\; nucleon$
:::

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   measure of how stable a nucleus is
    -   want this as big as possible
-   can repeat this calculation for all nuclei

## 

-   B/A rises rapidly through the lightest elements

-   hits a maximum of \~8.75 MeV around $^{56}Fe$

    -   (well, actually $^{62}Ni$)

-   decreases gradually beyond that

-   if we can turn elements into $^{56}Fe$, from either direction, we can release energy

    -   *fission* splits up heavier elements, moves up curve from the right
    -   *fusion* coalesces lighter elements, moves up curve from the left

## Equations

-   $1MeV = 1.6 \times 10^{-13}J = 1.78 \times 10^{-30}kg$

-   $Radius\;=\;1.2 \times \sqrt[3]{A}$ in femto-metres (1 fm = $10^{-15}m$)

-   $Binding\; E.\; per\; nucleon = \frac{938.272 \times Z + 939.565 \times (A-Z) - (mass\;in\;MeV)}{A}$
