## Summary

<br>

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
The nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. The stability of the nucleus relies on the short range nuclear force. The models produced can account for the nature and energy of radiation products, the results of scattering experiments, and the range of isotopes across the table of elements. We get a measure of stability, the *binding energy per nucleon* that peaks around iron.

The natural distance scale for the nucleus is the femtometre (1 fm = $10^{-15}m$), the natural energy or mass unit is the mega electron volt ($1MeV = 1.6 \times 10^{-13}J = 1.78 \times 10^{-30}kg$)

2.  Nuclear Sizes and Shapes
3.  The Nuclear Force
4.  Nuclear Masses and Binding Energies

## Nuclear Constituents

-   Nuclei consist of *protons* and *neutrons*

    -   these have almost exactly the same mass
    -   neutrons a little heavier, but by less than 0.2%

-   masses of nuclei are very nearly integers (when measured in amu)

-   intrinsic spin (and thus magnetic moment) of nucleus consistent with both neutrons and protons have spin $\frac{1}{2}$

## Notation

::: callout-note
## Syntax

-   Atomic Number ( **Z** ) is the number of protons in the nucleus.

-   Atomic Mass ( **A** ) is the combined number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.

-   Also, ( **N** ) is the number of neutrons, but we use that less often

$^A_ZElement\;e.g.\;^4_2He\;has\; A=4\; and\; Z=2\; (sometimes\; just\;^4He)$
:::

-   how many protons, neutrons in $^{226}_{88}Ra$ ? How about $^{56}Fe$ ?

-   ***Isotopes*** are nuclei with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons

    -   e.g. $^{208}_{82}Pb$, $^{207}_{82}Pb$, $^{206}_{82}Pb$, $^{204}_{82}Pb$

-   A solitary neutron isn't stable, decays with half-life of 878s (15 minutes)

    -   turns in to a proton and electron (and anti-neutrino)

-   Neutrons and protons aren't point particles (unlike the electron). Have radii of about 0.8fm.

    -   made of *quarks*

        -   $up^{+\frac{2}{3}} \quad up^{+\frac{2}{3}} \quad down^{-\frac{1}{3}}$ = $proton^{+1}$

        -   $up^{+\frac{2}{3}} \quad down^{-\frac{1}{3}} \quad down^{-\frac{1}{3}}$ = $neutron^0$

## Measuring mass in mega-electron volts (MeV)

-   electron volts measure energy
    -   literally energy an electron gets when it crosses a 1 volt battery
    -   charge on electron is $1.6 \times 10^{-19}C$, so energy is $1eV = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}Joules$
-   from relativity, $mass \; \leftrightarrow \; energy$
-   using $E = m\times c^2$ thus $mass = energy\; /\;c^2$ and we get:
-   $1eV = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} /\; c^2 = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} /\; (3 \times 10^8)^2 = 1.78 \times 10^{-36} kg$
-   $1MeV =  10^{6}eV  = 1.78 \times 10^{-30} kg$
:::

Makes for a handy unit to measure nuclear energies and masses.

## Nuclear Size

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   femtometer is natural unit for nucleus

    -   $1fm \; = \; 10^{-15}m$

-   nuclear radii range from 1fm to about 7fm

    -   very small compared to size of atom

-   measure using:

    -   electron diffraction
    -   isotope wavelength shifts
    -   Coulomb energies of mirror nuclei
    -   scattering of $\alpha$ particles
    -   $\alpha$ decay lifetimes
:::

## 

### Electron Diffraction

electrons have wavelengths given by:

$$\lambda \; = \; \frac{hc}{E}$$

diffraction minima at $$sin\theta \; = \; \frac{1.22 \times \lambda}{D}$$

420MeV ($\lambda \; = \; 2.95fm$) electrons give minimum at $50.5^{\circ}$ for $^{12}_6C$

gives nuclear radius of 2.33fm

## 

### Isotope Wavelength Shifts

![From Krane - Introductory Nuclear Physics](images/isotope-shifts.png)

The larger the nucleus, the less chance the electron (or in diagram above, muon) has to be in close proximity to a high concentration of charge

## 

### Mirror Nuclei

-   mirror nuclei have opposite numbers of protons and neutrons

    -   example $^3_1H$ and $^3_2He$ or $^7_3Li$ and $^7_4Be$

-   as far as the nuclear force is concerned, there is no difference between protons and neutrons

-   but the extra positive charge in $^3_2He$ carries a Coulomb penalty, which will depend on the average separation of the protons

-   can measure this energy difference by the maximum energy of positron from $\beta$ decay

## 

### $\alpha$ Decay

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   looking within a nucleus, we see temporary assemblages of $\alpha$ particles.

-   these aren't static, and collide up against the inner wall of the nucleus frequently

-   classically they don't have enough energy to escape, but can get out through quantum mechanical *tunnelling*

-   super sensitive to size of barrier, and the energy of this quasi-$alpha$ particle

    -   explains the extreme range of $\alpha$ half lives
    -   get correlation between half life and ejected $\alpha$ energy
:::

## 

### So, what is the size of a nucleus?

-   nuclear densities pretty much all the same

    -   $Radius\;=\;1.2 \times \sqrt[3]{A}$ in fm

-   surface a little proton rich

-   but charge and matter radii of nuclei agree to within 0.1fm

-   shape pretty spherical, a little oblate. Sometimes.

## Structure of Nucleus

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   must be something holding nucleus together, stopping positive protons flying apart

-   also need to explain radiation

    -   energies of $\alpha,\; \beta,\; \gamma$

    -   nuclear half lives

    -   scattering experiments (fire particles at nucleus and see how they bounce off)

    -   which nuclei are stable

-   behind all this is the ***Nuclear Force***, the left over remnants of the ***Strong Force***
:::

## Nuclear Force

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
Something has to hold the nucleus together. Some properties of this *nuclear force*

-   must be big, has to overcome Coulomb repulsion between protons

$E_{pp} \; = \; \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_\circ}\; \frac{e^2}{r}$ - this is about 1MeV for \~fm separation

-   in fact, quantum mechanics says it must be even bigger

-   particle in a box of size of a = 6fm (something like aluminium)

$E \; = \; \frac{3 \hbar^2 \pi^2}{2m_pa^2} \approx 20MeV$
:::

## 

### Nuclear Force

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   only relevant at fm distances, feeble at greater separations (\>3fm)

    -   see this from proton scattering

-   only effects protons and neutrons, not electrons

    -   it's like electrons are nuclear force *neutral*

-   agnostic to difference between protons and neutrons

-   repulsive at short (\< 0.5fm) distances

-   depends on spins of nucleons
:::

## Nuclear Force

-   no analytic form of nuclear force

    -   nothing like Coulomb's Law or Einstein's gravity

$F_{Coulomb} \; = \; \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{\circ}} \; \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}\;\;$ or $\;\;{\displaystyle G_{\mu \nu }+\Lambda g_{\mu \nu }=\kappa T_{\mu \nu },}$

-   but it does have an exponential term

    -   $F_{nuclear} \propto  e ^{-\frac{r}{R_0}}$

-   best modelled as an *exchange* force, mediated by some particle

-   first analysed by Yukawa

## 

### Yukawa Exchange Force

-   fire a proton at a neutron

    -   it will scatter off in different directions

    -   have to obey conservation of energy and momentum

    -   most will go straight through pretty much

        -   a neutron is a small target

    -   intensity decreases with angle

    -   *but* too many are scattered at up to $180^{\circ}$

    -   explained by the proton becoming the neutron and vice-versa

## 

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   has to be some particle being passed from neutron $\rightleftharpoons$ proton

-   only possible if we *borrow* energy using the uncertainty principle

    -   $\Delta E \Delta t \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}$

    -   $\Delta t$ given by time taken to cross nucleus at speed of light

        -   $\Delta t \le \frac{R}{c} = \frac{3 \times 10^{-15}}{3 \times 10^8} =  10^{-23}s$

        -   this gives $\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar c}{ 2 \times R}$

        -   gives a particle of about 100MeV (c.f. proton 938MeV, electron 0.511MeV)

        -   eventually discovered the **Pion** ($\pi^{\circ} \; and \; \pi^{\pm}$), which is made up a quark and anti--quark and has a mass of about 140MeV.
:::

## Investigating Nuclear Force - Deuteron

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   can get a bound state of a single proton and a single neutron, called *deuteron* (c.f. deuterium, $^2H$)

    -   something like the equivalent of a hydrogen atom for atomic structure

        -   the simplest possible system

-   don't get *proton-proton* or *neutron-neutron*

-   deuteron has the protons and neutron spins parallel ($l = 1$, triplet)

-   no excited states of deuteron (unfortunately)
:::

## 

### Investigating Nuclear Force - Deuteron

-   depth of potential well is about 35MeV (remember, $E \; = \; \frac{3 \hbar^2 \pi^2}{2m_pa^2}$, for deuteron we measure radius, = a/2, to be 2.1fm)

-   but separation energy (like *ionisation energy*) is 2.224MeV

    -   get this from binding energies and also from formation and disassociation energies (e.g. $^1H \; + \; n \; \rightarrow \; ^2H \; + \; \gamma$)

-   so deuteron *only* just exists, luckily for us

## 

### Nuclear Shell Model

-   Next level of complexity moves beyond simple potential well

-   protons and neutrons moving in orbits within nucleus

-   energy levels akin to atomic electron energy levels

-   nuclei with evens numbers of protons and even numbers of neutrons most stable

    -   protons and neutrons fill up energy levels independently\
    -   of the 288 nuclei found in nature, 169 are even-even, only 8 are odd-odd
    -   $^{2}D$, $^{8}Li$, $^{10}B$, $^{14}N$, $^{40}K$, $^{50}V$, $^{138}La$, $^{176}Lu$

## 

### Nuclear Shell - Quantum States

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   would like to be able to solve the Schrödinger equation for the nuclear potential, just like we can to solve the electronic levels of Hydrogen

    -   not possible because don't have a clean equation for the nuclear force/potential

    -   but can use some approximations to get useful results

-   end up with a ladder of quatum levels (c.f. 1s, 2s, 2p... atomic orbitals)

-   transitions between levels lead to the emission of light - $\gamma$ rays

-   separate suites of levels for protons and for neutrons
:::

## 

![Mateusz Sitarz - 2019 thesis - nuclear energy levels for $^{116}_{50}Sn$](images/sn-nuclear-levels.png)

## 

-   electrostatic repulsion between protons isn't nothing

    -   they're only \~ 1fm apart
    -   preference for neutrons (no repulsion)
    -   light nuclei have Z \~ N (equal numbers)
    -   heavier nuclei have more neutrons than protons

-   set of magic numbers (a.k.a. noble elements)

    -   2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126
    -   lots of isotopes for these elements

## Nuclear Binding Energy

-   nucleus is a little lighter than the sum of its parts

::: callout-note
## Binding Energy per Nucleon of $^{238}U$

-   mass of proton = 938.272 MeV
-   mass of neutron = 939.565 MeV
-   mass of $^{238}U$ = 221 743 MeV

$(938.272 \times 92 + 939.565 \times 146 - 221743) / 238 = 7.372\; MeV\; per\; nucleon$
:::

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   measure of how stable a nucleus is
    -   want this as big as possible
-   can repeat this calculation for all nuclei

## 

-   B/A rises rapidly through the lightest elements

-   hits a maximum of \~8.75 MeV around $^{56}Fe$

    -   (well, actually $^{62}Ni$)

-   decreases gradually beyond that

-   if we can turn elements into $^{56}Fe$, from either direction, we can release energy

    -   *fission* splits up heavier elements, moves up curve from the right
    -   *fusion* coalesces lighter elements, moves up curve from the left

## 

### Semiempirical Mass Formula

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   made of five terms

    -   an positive volume term proportional to A given by $a_{\nu} \; A$

    -   a negative surface term given by $-a_sA^{-\frac{2}{3}}$

        -   remember $Radius \; \propto \; A^{-\frac{1}{3}}$

    -   a negative Coulomb term depending on the number and separation of the protons. Given by $-a_cZ(Z-1)A^{-\frac{1}{3}}$ (again, remember the radius)

    -   a negative symmetric term favouring equal numbers of protons and neutrons, especially for light nuclei. Given by $-a_{sym}\frac{(A-2Z)^2}{A}$

    -   a positive pairing term favourising even numbers of protons / neutrons. Let's call this term just $\delta$
:::

## 

:::: {.callout-important title="Binding Energy Equation"}
::: {style="font-size: 120%;"}
$B = a_{\nu} A - a_sA^{-\frac{2}{3}} - a_cZ(Z-1)A^{-\frac{1}{3}} - a_{sym}\frac{(A-2Z)^2}{A} + \delta$

$\delta = \pm a_p A^{-\frac{3}{4}}$ "+" for Z/N even/even "-" for Z/N odd/odd else 0
:::
::::

-   a good fit for:

    -   $a_{\nu} = 15.5MeV$

    -   $a_{s} = 16.8MeV$

    -   $a_{c} = 0.72MeV$

    -   $a_{sym} = 23MeV$

    -   $a_{p} = 34MeV$

## Equations

-   $1MeV = 1.6 \times 10^{-13}J = 1.78 \times 10^{-30}kg$

-   $Radius\;=\;1.2 \times \sqrt[3]{A}$ in femto-metres (1 fm = $10^{-15}m$)

-   $Binding\; E.\; per\; nucleon = \frac{938.272 \times Z + 939.565 \times (A-Z) - (mass\;in\;MeV)}{A}$

-   $B = a_{\nu} A - a_sA^{-\frac{2}{3}} - a_cZ(Z-1)A^{-\frac{1}{3}} - a_{sym}\frac{(A-2Z)^2}{A} + \delta$
