## Summary

<br>

Unlike particles in boxes, SHO's and hydrogen-like ions, almost all problems in quantum mechanics are not exactly solvable. But there are a number of techniques to get sensible, if not exact, solutions for quantum systems. We'll look at two of these. The first is the *Variational Principle* in which we guess, and then optimise, a wavefunction in such a way to give an upper bound for the energy levels.

## More Complex Problems

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   Hydrogen atom can be solved exactly by time independent Schrödinger equation

-   Other problems aren’t so kind

    – Multi-electron atoms

    – Molecules

-   Need to cut some corners

    – Approximations

    – Astute guesses

-   We’ll begin with two foundation methods

    – Variation method

    – Perturbation theory

-   In practice, modifications / combinations of these two used
:::

## Variational Method

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   Get approximate energy of ground state without solving Schrödinger equation

-   Gives upper bound for ground state energy

-   Guess a trial wavefunction, $\phi$

    – $\phi$ must be normalisable

    – $\phi$ must satisfy relevant boundary conditions

    – Symmetry of problem leads us to $\phi$

    – Trying to make $\phi$ as close to what we think the real wavefunction, $\psi$, is as possible
:::

## 

-   Bound on ground state energy given by:

$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \phi^* H \phi \; dx^3 \ge \; E_0$

-   (or $\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \phi^* H \phi \; dx \ge \; E_0$ for 1-D problems)

-   H is the Hamiltonian, the energy operator for the system

-   Can be proved by expanding $\phi$ in terms of the (unknown) true wavefunctions $\psi$

-   Equation above assumes $\psi$ normalised

## 

-   In practice, skill in using variation method is astute choice of trial wavefunction

    -   often start with something like the SHO ground state: $\psi(x) = C e^{-\alpha x^2}$

-   If we happen to chance upon actual ground state wavefunction, $\psi_0$, then we’ll get an energy = $E_0$

-   Best way to use variation method

    – construct trial wavefunction with parameters that can be adjusted

    – Minimise value of integral by adjusting parameters

## 

<br>

-   Take particle in one dimensional box, problem we solved exactly before

    -   Chose $\phi = x(x-L)$ as the trial wavefunction

    – Satisfies boundary conditions

    – Not normalised yet

    – Remember hamiltonian:

## 

-   $H = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}  \frac{d^2}{dx^2}$

-   Remember $\phi = x(x-L)$ is the trial wavefunction

-   integral gives us

-   $\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \phi^* H \phi \; dx$, but really $\int_{0}^{+L} \phi^* H \phi \; dx = \frac{\hbar^2 L^3}{6m}$

-   to normalise we get $\int_{0}^{+L} \phi^* \phi \; dx = \frac{L^5}{30}$

-   putting together we get:

<center>$E_1 \le \frac{5 \hbar^2}{mL^2}$</center>

-   compare to $E_1 = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}$

-   agrees to better than 2% ($\frac{\pi^2}{2} = 4.935$)

## 

-   Previous example didn’t have adjustable parameters

    – In general not the case

    -   to be honest, result was kind of lucky

## 

-   Suppose we don’t know solution for SHO problem

-   Guess that it’s similar to 1-D box we did

-   $\phi = \sqrt{ \frac{2}{L} } \sin \frac{\pi x}{L}$ for $0 \le x \le L$

-   need to make box from $-L \le x \le +L$ by symmetry, and use cosine functions instead of sine

-   $\psi(x)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{L}} \cos(\frac{\pi x}{2L})$

## 

-   get $E_0 \le \frac{1}{L} \int_{-L}^L \cos \frac{\pi x}{2L}\left(\frac{- \hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2\right) \cos \frac{\pi x}{2L} dx$

-   $E_0 \le \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{8 m L^2} +  m \omega^2 L^2 (\frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{\pi^2})$

-   set $\frac{dE_0}{dL} = 0$ to get minimum of this and find $L = 1.302 \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m \omega}}$

-   then $E_0 \le 0.839 \hbar \omega$

-   not a great choice of initial wavefunction

    -   $\psi(x)$ is too heavy when you get towards $\pm L$

-   but still an instructive result

## 

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}

-   To find higher energy states, above ground state

    – Use trial wavefunctions that are orthonormal to ground state

    -   for example, for the SHO we could use $\psi_1(x) = A x \cos(\frac{\pi x}{2 L})$

    -   $\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x \cos^2(\frac{\pi x}{2 L}) dx = 0$ because $x \cos (\frac{\pi x}{2 L})$ and $\cos (\frac{\pi x}{2 L})$ are orthogonal

-   Note that while estimations of energy levels can be pretty good, harder to get good picture of wavefunctions from adjusted trial wavefunctions

-   Variational Method pretty useful for the quantum mechanics of $He$ and of the $H_2$ molecule
