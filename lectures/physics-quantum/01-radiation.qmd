## Notation

::: callout-note
## Syntax

$^A_ZElement\;e.g.\;^4_2He\;has\; A=4\; and\; Z=2\; (sometimes\; just\;^4He)$
:::

-   radioactivity originates in the nucleus. We need to develop a notation to discribe the processes in the nucleus.

-   Atomic Number ( Z ) is the number of protons in the nucleus.

-   Atomic Mass ( A ) is the combined number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.

-   ***Isotopes*** are nuclei with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons

## Nucleus emits an $\alpha$ particle

-   loses two protons and two neutrons
-   Z decreases by 2 and A decreases by 4
    -   $^A_ZParent\;=>\;^{A-4}_{Z-2}Daughter\;+\;\alpha$
-   examples
    -   $^{238}_{92}U\;=>\;^{234}_{90}Th\;+\;\alpha$
    -   $^{210}_{84}Po\;=>\;^{206}_{82}Pb\;+\;\alpha$

## Nucleus emits a $\beta$ particle

-   neutron in the nucleus splits into a proton and an electron
-   electron emitted as a beta particle
-   Z increases by 1 and A remains the same
    -   $^A_DP\;=>\;^{A}_{Z+1}D\;+\;\beta \; + \; \nu$
-   examples
    -   $^{99}_{42}Mo\;=>\;^{99}_{43}Tc\;+\;\beta \; + \; \nu$
    -   $^{14}_{6}C\;=>\;^{14}_{7}N\;+\;\beta \; + \; \nu$

## Nucleus emits an $\gamma$ ray

-   no change in A, Z, just loss of excess energy from nucleus

## Sources of Radiation

### $\alpha$ particles

-   almost all alpha particles originate in the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei e.g. $^{238}U$, $^{226}Ra$, etc.
-   $^{208}Pb$ is the heaviest stable nucleus known.
-   typically $\alpha$ energy of 4MeV ($6.4 \times 10^{-13}$ Joules)
-   \~highest is $^{212}_{84}Po\; \rightarrow \; ^{208}_{82}Pb \;+\; \alpha\;+\;8.78MeV$

## 

### $\beta$ particles

-   naturally occuring sources of beta particles are rare.
-   They can be prepared by irradiating target nuclei with neutrons ( e.g. $^{125}I$ for thryoid treatments ).
-   The beta emitter $^{14}C$ is produced by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere
-   bigger range of energies than $\alpha$ particles
    -   3.5MeV for $^{137}_{54}Xe \; \rightarrow \; ^{137}_{55}Cs \;+ \; \beta \; + \; \nu$
    -   18keV for $^{3}_{1}T \; \rightarrow \; ^{3}_{2}He \;+ \; \beta \; + \; \nu$

## 

### $\gamma$ rays

-   after $\alpha$ or $\beta$ decay, the daughter nucleus contains excess energy.
-   This is liberated by the release of a $\gamma$ ray
-   about 100keV typical energy

## Applications of Radiation

### Medicine;

-   diagnostic imaging: radioactive tracers ($^{99}Tc$) latch onto a particular chemical in the body. The distribution of this chemical can be followed by radiation detectors
-   PET scans use $^{18}F$ tracers to detect cancers.
-   radiotherapy: focus radiation in the diseased part of the body, healthy cells recover, diseased cells die. $^{131}I$ in treatment of thyroid disorders.

## 

### Appliances:

-   devices such as smoke detectors use radiation ($\alpha$ particles from $^{241}Am$)

### Archeology:

-   radioactive dating; in dead material the ratio of $^{14}C$ to $^{12}C$ determines age.
-   $^{14}C$ has a useful half-life of 5730 years
-   Works for aging rocks as well; ratio of Uranium to Lead.

## 

### Engineering;

-   checking welds
-   thickness control
-   testing wear and tear of a machine
-   leak detection
-   sterilising food

## Radiation Safety

-   radiation damages tissue
    -   produces reactive chemicals (radicals) in the body
-   $\alpha$ particles are the most dangerous, considered 20 times more dangerous than $\beta$'s
    -   because they all their energy in a smaller volume
-   $\gamma$ rays are more difficult to control because of their greater penetration

## Radon

-   large dose of radiation due to the build up of radon in houses
-   radon decays to polonium, bismuth, etc. These latch onto dust particles and can be absorbed by the lungs. They emit a cascade of alpha particles
-   20,000 deaths (lung cancer) per year in the USA due to radon

## 

-   radon dose determined by:
    -   amount of uranium in underlying rocks
    -   permeability of topsoil
    -   cracks and fissures in floor
    -   ventilation in house
-   buildings from 1980's on
    -   fine, contain impermeable plastic layer in foundations
-   buildings from before 1950's
    -   fine, because so draughty

## Radioactive Decay Laws

-   decay of individual nucleus is a totally random process, occurs with certain probability in a certain time period
-   for large numbers of nuclei can use statistics
-   rate of disintegrations from a nuclear source is proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei present

## 

::: callout-tip
## Mathematics of Radioactive exponential decay

-   $-\frac{dN}{dt}\;\alpha\;N$
-   $-\frac{dN}{dt}\;=\;\lambda\;N$
-   $N\;=\;N_0e^{-\lambda t}$
:::

-   where N is the number of radioactive nuclei present at a particular time
-   $-\frac{dN}{dt}$ is the rate of decrease in N.
-   $N_o$ is the original number of nuclei present.
-   $\lambda$ is called the radioactive decay constant and depends on the nature of the nucleus

## Radioactive Half Life, $t_{1/2}$

-   a convenient way of discribing radioactive decay is in terms of the radioactive half life, $t_{1/2}$ .
-   the half life is defined as the time taken for the number of radioactive nuclei present in a source to fall to half itâ€™s original value.
-   half lives of naturally occurring radioisotopes vary over a wide range
    -   $3 \times 10^{-7}$s ($^{212}Po$) to $1.4 \times 10^{10}$years ($^{232}Th$)

## 

::: callout-tip
## the half life is related to the decay constant by:

-   $t_{1/2}\;=\;\frac{log_e2}{\lambda}\;=\;\frac{0.693}{\lambda}$
:::

## Measurement of Radiation

### Activity

-   This is the number of disintegrations occurring per second.
-   It is easily measured with a Geiger counter.
-   This activity is proportional to the number of radioactive atoms in the sample.\
-   $Activity\;=\; -\frac{dN}{dt}\; =\;\lambda N$

## 

### The units of activity are:

-   Curie (Ci)
    -   $1\;Ci\; =\; 3.7 \times10^{10}\; disintegrations/sec$
    -   A clinical source of $^{60}Co$ has an activity of several Ci
    -   An internally administered dose for cancer treatment would have an activity of $10^{-3}$ Ci
-   Becquerel (Bq)
    -   1 Bq = 1.0 disintegrations /sec
    -   This is the SI. unit (1 Ci = $3.7 \times 10^{10}$ Bq)

## Absorbed Dose

-   This is the effect of the radiation on the absorbing material
-   The SI unit for absorbed dose is the gray (Gy) which is the amount of radiation which deposits energy at a rate of 1 J / kg in any absorbing material.
    -   (The old unit was the rad ... 1 Gy = 100 rad)
-   The absorbed dose depends on
    1.  the strength of a given radiation beam (number of particles per second)
    2.  the energy per particle but also on the type of material absorbing the radiation

## 

-   This is not the most meaningful units for measuring the biological damage produced by radiation.
-   This is because equal doses of different types of radiation cause differing amounts of damage (1 gray of $\alpha$ particles produces 10 to 20 times the damage of 1 gray of $\beta$ particles or $\gamma$ rays)
-   This is because the $\alpha$ particles move more slowly than $\beta$ and $\gamma$ rays of equal energy due to their greater mass and ionising collisions occur closer together resulting in more irreparable damage

## 

-   The ***relative biological effectiveness (RBE)*** or quality factor (QF) of a given type of radiation is defined as the number of grays of X-ray or $\gamma$ radiation that produces the same biological damage as 1 gray of the given radiation.
-   The product of the dose in grays and the QF gives a unit of sieverts (previously rem)
-   1 sievert of any type of radiation does the same approximate biological damage
    -   Radioactive background 1.3 mSv /year
    -   X-rays 0.7 mSv / year

## Exposure Limits

-   5 mSv per year exposure to the general population
-   50 mSv per year to nuclear workers
-   A 4 Sv dose in a short interval of time is fatal with 50% of cases but when spread over a few weeks it is not usually fatal.
-   A 10 Sv dose is nearly always fatal

## Principle sources of radiation

-   Radon - 1mSv per year
-   CT scans - 0.8mSv per year
-   Nuclear Medcine - 0.4mSv per year
-   Cosmic Rays - 0.15mSv per year
-   internal radiation (mostly potassium, $^{40}K$) 0.03mSv per year
-   get total of about $10\mu Sv$ per day. Below legal limit.

## Equations

- $N\;=\;N_0e^{-\lambda t}$

- $t_{1/2}\;=\;\frac{log_e2}{\lambda}\;=\;\frac{0.693}{\lambda}$

- $Bq = Ci \times 3.7\times10^{10}$

- $(energy\;in\;joules) = MeV \times 1.6\times 10^{-13}$

- $Gray = \frac{Bq \times (energy\;in\;joules)}{(person\;mass\; in \;kg)}$

- $Sv = \frac{Bq \times (energy\;in\;joules) \times RBE }{(person\;mass\; in \;kg)}$

- $(expected\;number\; of\; deaths) = \frac{(dose\; in\; Sievert) \times (population)}{50}$
