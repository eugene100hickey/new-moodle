## Summary

There are *17* fundamental particles. They are divided into groups. The first splitting is into the 12 ***fermions*** (obey Pauli Exclusion Principle) and the 5 ***bosons*** (force carriers, e.g. photons). Fermions are further split into ***leptons*** (no *strong* interactions, e.g. electrons) and ***baryons*** (e.g. protons and neutrons). There are also antimatter equivalents for all these particles (though sometimes the antimatter particle is the same as the regular one).

These particles are grouped according to the ***Standard Model***.

## Fermions vs Bosons

-   fermions have half integer spin ($\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{5}{2}..$)
-   bosons have integer spin (0, 1, 2...)

<br>

-   fermions need to satisfy Pauli

<br>

-   fermions are the *particles*
-   bosons are force carriers

## Fermions - the fundamental leptons

-   6 of these
    -   electron
    -   muon
    -   tau
    -   electron neutrino
    -   muon neutrino
    -   tau neutrino

## Muons ($\mu$)

-   like heavy electrons (mass = 105.66MeV)

-   same charge, spin (like little magnet), lepton number (dictates what they can decay into, and what can decay into them)

-   unstable, lifetime of 2.2$\mu s$, always produces an electron

-   produced in the upper atmosphere by cosmic rays (mostly protons) striking atmospheric molecules

    -   the fact they can reach the ground before decaying is a beautiful demonstation of relativistic time dilation
    -   about 1 muon per minute per $cm^2$

## Tau ($\tau$)

-   like an even heavier electron (mass = 1.78GeV)

-   again, same charge, spin, etc, as electrons and muons

-   unstable, lifetime of $2.9 \times 10^{-13}s$

-   many different routes of decay, including baryons

    -   this is because $\tau$ is so heavy

-   only detected in the laboratory, not seen in nature

## Neutrinos ($\nu$)

-   ghost like particle

    -   no charge
    -   not much mass (\<1eV)

-   mostly produced by $\beta$ decays

-   three different types, one for each of the leptons above

    -   electron neutrino, $\nu _{e}$
    -   muon neutrino, $\nu _{\mu}$
    -   tau neutrino, $\nu _{\tau}$

## 

-   vaste numbers produced in the Sun
    -   1 trillion solar $\nu$'s pass through you every second
    -   you'll only absorb one in your lifetime
-   really hard to detect
    -   take an old gold mine in South Dakota
    -   fill it with cleaning fluid
    -   wait
    -   about once a day get $\nu _{e}+\ ^{37}Cl\longrightarrow \ ^{37}Ar^{+}+e^{-}$

## 

-   following on from Homestake, other neutrino observatories such as:
    -   SuperKamiokande in Japan
    -   Sudbury (SNO) in Ontario
    -   IceCube at the South Pole (literally) - $1km^3$
-   in February 1987, sudden burst of $\nu$'s detected at various neutrino observatories
    -   several hours later, light from a supernova in a nearby galaxy reached Earth
    -   first time we'd seen this

## Fermions - the baryons

-   protons and neutrons aren't fundamental
    -   they have internal structure
    -   contain ***quarks***
    -   proton has 2 *up* and 1 *down* quarks
    -   neutron has 1 *up* and 2 *down* quarks
    -   *up* and *down* are two examples of the 6 quarks

## Fermions - the fundamental baryons (Quarks)

z <- tribble(~quark, ~mass, ~charge,
              "up", "2.16MeV", "+2/3",
              "down", "4.7MeV", "-1/3",
              "strange", "93.5MeV", "-1/3", 
              "charm", "1.273GeV", "+2/3",
              "bottom", "4.183GeV",  "-1/3",

  tab_options(table.font.size = 24)
```

-   note that $m_{proton}\gg 2 \times m_{up} + m_{down}$

## Strong Force

-   quarks have ***colour*** and are subject to the strong force
    -   colours are *red*, *green*, and *blue*
    -   (and *antired*, *antigreen*, and *antiblue*)
    -   particles always have to be colour neutral
        -   red / green / blue
        -   antired / antigreen / antiblue
        -   red / antired, etc
    -   force gets stronger with distance

## Mesons

-   we observe quarks in triplets (e.g. proton), but also in pairs

    -   these are called mesons

-   pions (\~135MeV) are the lightest, made of up and/or down quarks

-   kaons (\~500MeV) are similar, feature a strange quark

## Particle Mass

-   things like particle charge, spin, etc have definite values

-   mass on the other hand seems more arbitrary

    -   needs to be experimentally measured
    -   see resonances in particle collider results

-   mass is an *extrinsic* (as opposed to intrinsic) quantity

## 

-   acquired by particles as they move through the Higg's Field

    -   Higg's Field slows them down
    -   if a particle doesn't move at the light speed, it must have rest mass

-   massless particles like photons ($\gamma$) or gluons don't interact with the Higg's Field, they must always move at the speed of light

-   time flows from left to right

-   fermions represented by stright lines, bosons by wiggles, gluons by spirals

-   time flows backwards for anti-particles

-   at every vertex, quantities must be conserved

## Shortcomings of the Standard Model

-   very much a work in progress

-   doesn't say much about particle masses

-   doesn't have a strong candidate for *Dark Matter*

-   doesn't have a strong candidate for *Dark Energy*

## 

-   unknown why we live in a world of matter, not anti-matter

-   potential anomaly in magnetic moment of mesons

-   tough to reconcile with General Relativity

    -   looking to detect ***Gravitons***

-   neutrinos do something strange, seem to flip between $\nu_e$, $\nu_{\mu}$, and $\nu_{\tau}$
