## Summary

To determine crystal structure, we need light of wavelength comparable to the size of the unit cells. These are X-rays. We'll discuss how these are produced. Then we'll see how we use them to determine the size and symmetries of the unit cell. Along with NMR, X-ray diffraction (XRD) is one of the main techniques of molecular structure determination.

## X-Ray Diffraction

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   This technique is for characterising crystalline materials
    -   in a simple exercise it can distinguish a crystalline from an amorphous specimen
-   It primarily provides information on crystal structure
    -   Lattice type
    -   Crystal type
-   compliments NMR for molecular characterisation
:::

## Requirements for XRD

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   Source of X-Rays;
    -   X-rays are collimated (into parallel beam) and directed onto the sample
-   Crystal or powder sample
-   X-ray detector
    -   The detector records and processes the X-ray signal diffracted from the sample and converts the signal to a count rate or intensity.
    -   The detector can sometimes be a photographic plate which will have a pattern (of dots or circles); In this case a CCD (charge-coupled device) converts the intensity of the pattern into an electrical signal which are then sent to a computer for processing.

## Principle: (of Bragg-Bretano XRD)

-   Interference between X-ray beams reflected from the crystal planes
-   Monochromatic x-ray beam directed at crystal;
    -   Beams are scattered from each set of crystal planes at specific angles.
    -   X-ray diffraction peaks are produced by constructive interference of these reflected (scattered) beams.
    -   We need x-rays (rather than any other EM radiation) for this because we need the wavelength of the radiation to be approximately the same as the spacing of the crystal planes.

## 

-   Treat the crystal as stacks of reflecting planes;

-   There are planes in many different orientations and many different separations; depending on the crystal type.

-   For any one set of planes, separated by distance “d”, the incoming x-ray beam must make a particular angle, θ, called the Bragg angle, in order for constructive interference to occur between the beams reflected from successive planes

## Bragg Reflection

$ n \times \lambda = 2 \times d \times sin \theta $$

## Relationship between ***d*** and ***a***

-   The separation of a given set of planes in a crystal $d_{hkl}$ can be determined by measuring the angle at which x-rays of known wavelength are strongly reflected. The relation between d and the lattice parameter of the plane (for the cubic structure) is given by:

$d \; = \;\frac{a}{\sqrt {h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}$

-   This formula holds for the cubic structure only
    -   equivalent relationships hold for other structures

## 

-   For ***orthorhombic*** structures, get

$\frac{1}{d^2} \; = \;\frac{h^2}{a^2} + \frac{k^2}{b^2} + \frac{l^2}{c^2}$

## Samples and Methods

-   Two methods:
    -   Single-crystal diffraction
    -   Powder (polycrystalline) diffraction
-   Single Crystal:
    -   Get full information on crystal structure
    -   Crystal type, lattice parameters, density of atoms on planes etc.
-   Powder:
    -   Get finger-print (ID)

## Pros and Cons

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   Advantages of Single Crystal XRD :
    -   Detailed crystal structure;
    -   Unambiguous (no confusion about results)
-   Disadvantages:
    -   Must have a single, robust (stable) sample, generally between 50—250 microns in size
    -   Must be an optically clear sample
    -   Data collection generally requires between 24 and 72 hours
-   Advantages of Powder XRD
    -   Easy to prepare sample:
    -   Grind down to particle size of 0.002 mm and press into a sample holder.

## Single Crystal Diffraction

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   Crystal is mounted on a goniometer in centre;
-   This allows for orientation;
-   Crystal is slowly rotated (so that θ for differently oriented planes can be made to satisfy Bragg Law.
-   The scan is called a “locked coupled scan” because as the crystal is moved through angle Δθ , detector is moved through angle 2 Δθ (so it will pick up reflections if they exist).
-   Detector records angle and intensity.

## Powder Patterns

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   In every crystal type there are many planes at different orientations.
-   If a single crystal is being used, the Bragg’s law might be fulfilled for one set of planes while another set of planes could cause destructive interference
    -   Planes will not be oriented to satisfy Braggs Law
    -   Hence crystal has to be rotated.
-   When a sample is in powder form however
    -   at least some of the crystallites will always be orientated so as to satisfy the Bragg condition for each set of crystal planes that exist;
-   So the full quota of crystal planes will show up.

## Spectrum Dependence on State of Substance

![](images/crystal-glassy.png)

## Problems

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
1.  A first order reflection from the (111) planes of a cubic crystal was observed at a glancing angle of $\theta_{111}$ = 11.2$^{\circ}$ when Cu Kα X-rays of wavelength 0.154051 nm were used.
    1.  Calculate $d_{111}$
    2.  What is the length of the side of the unit cell?
    3.  Calculate $d_{123}$
    4.  Calculate the angle, from which the same lattice will give a reflection from the (123) plane.

\[0.397nm, 0.687nm, 0.191nm, $\theta_{123}$ = 23.85$^{\circ}$\]

2.  The (111) planes in potassium iodide correspond to the first reflection in the X-ray spectrum. Calculate the minimum value of $\theta$ for KI using $\lambda _{CuK\alpha}$ = 0.154051 nm and a = 0.70655 nm for the cubic unit cell.

\[$9.25^{\circ}$\]

## Extinctions

- This means that reflections from some sets planes are cancelled out.
- Knowing which planes are NOT giving reflections lets us determine what type of cubic structure is diffracting the x-rays. 
    - BCC structures h + k + l  must be even
    - FCC h, k and l themselves must be either all odd or all even

## Scattering Factor

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}

- The argument about extinction can only apply if the atoms/ions in the different planes have the same scattering strenghts.
    - The scattering strength (factor) of an atom/ion is related to its electron density distribution.

- This difference in scattering strength can even affect the pattern we get from similar type cells.
    - For example, the x-ray powder patterns for NaCl and KCl are different despite both crystals being FFC.
    - This is due the different scattering strengths of the ions: 

- Scattering factor for Na+, K+ and Cl- are 10, 18 and 18 respectively.  
    - When waves from the + ion and the –ion should be cancelling out (destructive interference) 
    - this will not happen completely for Na+  and Cl-, but will be complete for K+  and Cl- 
    - So there are lines missing in KCl that are weakly present in NaCl

## Equations

- $n\;\lambda = 2\;d\;sin\theta$

- $d \; = \;\frac{a}{\sqrt {h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}$

- $\frac{1}{d^2} \; = \;\frac{h^2}{a^2} + \frac{k^2}{b^2} + \frac{l^2}{c^2}$

- Body centred: $h\;+\;k\;+\;l\;=\;even$

- Face centred: h, k, l all even or all odd
