## Summary

In our first application of the Schrödinger Equation, we'll look at a particle in a 1 -dimensional box. This particle is at zero potential in the interval $0 \leq x \leq a$ but cannot move outside these bounds.

## Time Dependent Schrödinger Equation

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   finished last week with the Time Dependent Schrödinger Equation

<center>$i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial ^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V\Psi$</center>

-   Lots of times the potential, V, doesn’t depend on time, just position.

-   There’s a neat trick called separation of variables we can use now.

<center>$\Psi (x, t) = \psi (x) T(t)$</center>
:::

## 

-   Get:

<center>$i \hbar \frac{1}{T} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = - \frac{1}{\psi} \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial ^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V(x)$</center>

<br>

-   Left hand side just depends on time, right hand side just on x

$\implies$ both sides must be equal to some constant, call it E say

$\implies$ got ourselves two equations here

## Time Dependence

-   Working with the left (time) side of the equation gives us:

<center>$i \hbar \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = E \times T(t)$</center>

-   Solutions to this are fairly straightforward and not that interesting

<center>$T(t) = A e^{-iEt/\hbar}$</center>

-   Gives temporal oscillations of the wavefunction

## Time Independent Schrödinger Equation

-   On the other hand, the spatial element is rich in solutions, depends on shape of V(x)

-   Get

<center>$- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial ^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + V(x) \psi = E \psi$</center>

-   This is the time independent Schrödinger Equation

-   Turns out, when we compare to the free space version, that E is the total energy of the system.

## Boundary Conditions

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}
-   Solving problems using Time independent Schrödinger Equation means

    -   Applying different natures of the potential, V

    -   But also using boundary conditions, constraints on the wavefunction that tell us about the possible solutions

        -   Wavefunction must be a continuous single valued function of position and time

        -   The integral of the squared value of the wavefunction over all values of x must be finite (normalisable)

        -   The first derivatives of the wavefunction in x must be continuous everywhere except when there is an infinite discontinuity in the potential

-   We'll first look at the nature of solutions to Schrödinger's Equation, and then tackle some examples and put Schrödinger to work
:::

## Solutions of Schrödinger's Equation

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
-   Equation is linear in $\psi$

    -   Superposition principle, if $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ are solutions then so is $\psi_1 + \psi_2$

        -   and indeed $A\psi_1 + B\psi_2$

-   Solution solved by eigenfunctions, $\psi_n$, and corresponding eigenvalues, $E_n$

-   Set of all solutions forms an orthogonal basis set

    -   $\int \psi_n \psi_m dx = 0 \;if \; n \neq m$

    -   Can make up any function from linear combination of $\psi$'s

        -   $F(x) = \Sigma \psi_n$
:::

## Examples of Time Independent Schrödinger Equation

-   Infinite square well

-   Finite square well

-   Harmonic oscillator

-   All of these are 1-D

-   We'll advance to 3-D later

    – Hydrogen atom

    – etc

## Infinite Square Well (Particle in a Box)

:::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

- V(x) has the form

    + V = 0 when $0<x<L$
    
    + V = $\infty$ when $x<0 \; or\; x>L$

## Infinite Square Well - Solutions

- Within the well, the Schrödinger Equation becomes:

<center>$- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial ^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} = E \psi$</center>

- General solution has the form

<center>$\psi = A cos(kx) + B\sin(kx)$</center>

- Where

<center>$k = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}}$</center>

## ISW - Boundary Conditions

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}

- Boundary conditions dictate $\psi$ that vanishes at 0 and L

<center>$0 = A cos(k0) + B\sin(k0)$</center>

<center>$0 = A cos(kL) + B\sin(kL)$</center>

- First condition must mean A=0
    + If A=0 then $\sin(kL) = 0$ and $k = n\pi /L$, n=1, 2, 3..
        - (not n = 0 because that would give $\psi = 0$ everywhere)
        

- Means $E_n = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2 n^2}{2mL^2}$

- when we normalise we get

## Spectra of Conjugated Dyes

<br>

- Absorption caused by transition from highest filled orbital ($n_{HFO}$) to lowest unfilled orbital ($n_{LUO}$)

    + Get one electron from each carbon plus three from the nitrogens
    + N = (no of carbons) + 3
    
- $n_{HFO} = N/2$ and $n_{LUO} = N/2 + 1$ (Pauli Exclusion)

##

Remember $E_n = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2 n^2}{2mL^2}$ for infinite square well
$\Delta E = E_{LUO} – E_{HFO} = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2n_{LUO}^2}{2mL^2} - \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2n_{HFO}^2}{2mL^2}$

$\implies \Delta E = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2mL^2} (n_{LUO}^2 - n_{HFO}^2)$

$\implies \Delta E = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2mL^2} [(\frac{N}{2} + 1)^2 - (\frac{N}{2})^2]$

$\implies \Delta E = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2mL^2} (N + 1)$

$\Delta E = 6.024 \times10^{-38} (N+1)/ L^2$

taking $h=6.626 \times 10^{-34}Js$ and $m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31}kg$

##

- $\Delta E = 6.024 \times10^{-38} (N+1)/ L^2$

- Application to dyes on slide 17 gives:

    + L for 3 carbons is 0.809nm
    + L for 5 carbons is 1.056nm
    + L for 7 carbons is 1.307nm
    
- Compares OK with C-C bond length of 0.146nm and C=C bond length of 0.134nm

- (remember $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$)

## Spectrum of Butadiene

- Four carbon molecule

    - Four $\pi$ electrons, N=4
    
    - Get $\Delta E = \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2 n^2}{2mL^2}(N+1) = \frac{5 \hbar^2 \pi^2}{2mL^2}$

- Length of molecule is (two double bonds) + (one single bond) + (a bit more at each end, say a total of a single bond)

- This gives L = 0.56nm

- Then $E = 9.61 \times 10^{-19}J$

- And $\lambda_{max}$ = 207nm

- Compares to experimental value of 210nm

- Got to admit agreement is pretty lucky, but still shows power of QM

## Selection Rules for Square Well

- Not all transitions allowed, some have probability=0

- We’ll work out these selection rules for the infinite square well potential

- We’ll also show how longer molecules have stronger absorbtion

##
<br>

- Incident light causes transition from occupied level to higher previously unoccupied level

- Absorbs energy from light beam

- Strength of light-molecule interaction depends on electric dipole moment of molecule

    + $\epsilon = - \mu .E$ where $\mu$ is dipole moment
    
    + $\mu = \Sigma x_i e_i$ where x is position and e is charge
    
- Light has long wavelength so E doesn’t depend on x

## 

- In quantum mechanics, the transition dipole moment is given by:

<center>$\mu = \int \psi_f \;ex\; \psi_i dx$</center>

<br>

- When we evaluate this integral for the wavefunctions of the square well, we can see which ones disappear

- They disappear because integral = 0 because of symmetry

- These will be forbidden transitions

##

$\mu = - \int_0^L \psi_{final} \; ex\; \psi_{initial}\; dx$

$\implies \mu = - \frac{2e}{L} \int_0^L x \sin(\frac{n_{final} \pi x}{L}) \; \sin(\frac{n_{initial} \pi x}{L})\; dx$

- but $\sin(x) \sin(y) = \frac{1}{2} [ \cos(x-y) - \cos(x+y)]$

$\implies \mu = - \frac{e}{L} \int_0^L x [\cos(\frac{ \pi x ( n_{final} - n_{initial})}{L}) \;- \; \cos(\frac{ \pi x ( n_{final} + n_{initial})}{L})]\; dx$

##

- do this integration by parts using u = x and $dv = \cos(x)dx$

- gives $\int_0^L x\; \cos(ax)\; dx = [\frac{x}{a} \sin(ax) + \frac{1}{a^2}\cos(ax)]_0^L$

- then 

$\mu = - \frac{e}{L} (\frac{L}{\pi})^2[\frac{1}{n_{diff}^2}(\cos(n_{diff}\pi)-1) - \frac{1}{n_{total}^2}(\cos(n_{total}\pi)-1)$

$+ \frac{1}{n_{diff}} \sin(n_{diff}\pi) - \frac{1}{n_{total}} \sin(n_{total}\pi)]$ 

where $n_{diff} = n_{final} - n_{initial}$ and $n_{total} = n_{final} + n_{initial}$

##

See what happens when n is even or odd

- if n is even then $\cos(n\pi) - 1 = 0$ and $\sin(n\pi) = 0$

$\implies \mu = 0$ when $n_{diff}$ is even and $n_{total}$ is even

- this happens if both $n_{initial}$ and $n_{final}$ are both even or both odd

##

-on the other hand if one is even and the other odd

$\mu = \frac{2eL}{\pi^2}[\frac{1}{n_{diff}^2} - \frac{1}{n_{total}^2}]$

$\implies \mu = \frac{2eL}{\pi^2}[\frac{n_{initial}\times n_{final}}{n_{initial}^2 - n_{final}^2}]$

##

- This all means:

    + No transition if initial and final state have  same parity
        - i.e. both even or both odd
    + Transition if initial and final states have opposite parity
        - ($n_{initial} – n_{final}$) must be odd
        
    + Transition strength increases with L
        - Long molecules absorb strongly
        - See spectra on page 17
