## Summary

<br>

An alternative to the Variational Method if Perturbation Theory. Oftentimes, while we might not be able to get exact solutions to our system of interest, there exist such solutions for another, similar system. We can treat the differences between these two systems as a _correction_, or perturbation, and watch how that effects the results as it propagates through our calculations. This lets us see the impact of the modification from the ideal to the actual system, and gives us an indication of how accurate our approximation is.

## Perturbation Theory


- Alternative to variation method

- Again, relies on having the Hamiltonian, i.e. the statement of the TimeIndepSchröE

- Also, need to have solution to another system which is very comparable

- But this happens a lot

- Examples:

    - anharmonic terms in SHO
    
    - Hydrogen in a weak electric field
    
    - The Helium atom



## 

- Express Hamiltonian as:

- $H = H_0 + \lambda \;H_1$

    – $\lambda$ can be =1, but it helps us keep track of order of approximation

- Shrödinger Equation becomes:

    - $(H_0 + \lambda H_1)\psi_n = E_n \psi_n$

- We’re going to say that the solution to the unperturbed system is;

- $H_0 \psi^{(0)}_n = E^{(0)}_n \psi^{(0)}_n$

## 

- Let’s do some maths now:

- Express $E_n$ and $\psi_n$ as Taylor Series expansion in $\lambda$

- $E_n = E_n^{(0)} + \lambda E_n^{(1)} + \lambda^2 E_n^{(2)} + ....$

- $\psi_n = \psi_n^{(0)} + \lambda \psi_n^{(1)} + \lambda^2 \psi_n^{(2)} + ....$

- Putting these back into Schrödinger we get:

- $H_0 \psi^{(0)}_n = E^{(0)}_n \psi^{(0)}_n$

- $H_1 \psi^{(0)}_n + H_0 \psi^{(1)}_n = E^{(0)}_n \psi^{(1)}_n + E^{(1)}_n \psi^{(0)}_n$ - the first order correction

- $H_1 \psi^{(1)}_n + H_0 \psi^{(2)}_n = E^{(0)}_n \psi^{(2)}_n + E^{(1)}_n \psi^{(1)}_n  + E^{(2)}_n \psi^{(0)}_n$ - the second order correction



- Zeroth order is just the unperturbed system

- Higher orders give corrections

## 

- Get first order corrections given by:

- $E^{(1)}_n =\int \psi_n^{(0)} H_1 \psi_n^{(0)} dx$

- $\psi^{(1)}_n= \Sigma _{m \ne n} \frac{\int \psi^{(0)}_m H_1 \psi^{(0)}_n dx}{E^{(0)}_n - E^{(0)}_m} \psi^{(0)}_m$



- Energy correction given by impact of perturbing potential on (unperturbed) ground state

-  Wavefunction correction given by mixing pieces of excited states with ground state

## Example - Anharmonic oscillator

- Anharmonic oscillator, potential: $V = \frac{1}{2}m \omega^2 x^2 + \gamma x^4$

- Remember, ground state: $\psi(x) = \frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar} e^{-(m \omega x^2/\hbar)}$


- Gives $En^{(1)} = \frac{3\hbar^2 \gamma}  {m^2 \omega^2}$

- For small perturbations gives good agreement with experiment

## Perturbation versus Variation

- Perturbation can be hard to do because of infinite sums over discrete states and integrals over continuum states in higher order corrections

- Perturbation does energy to order $2n+1$ whereas wavefunction only to order $n$

- Remember, Variation also does energy better than wavefunction


## Equations

-   $\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \phi^* H \phi \; dx^3 \ge \; E_0$
