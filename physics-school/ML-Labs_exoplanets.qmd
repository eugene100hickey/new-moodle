## Summary

Astrophysics is a rich terrain for Data Science techniques. Large amounts of high quality data, freely available, and underanalysed.

## Astrodata

::: {style="font-size: 100%;"}

- astronomy at the forefront of big data

    + seems to come in waves
    
    + next up is Vera Rubin and SKA

- data is pretty much always openly available

- pretty well curated

- always interesting to put data from different sources together

:::

## Where to find it

- [Simbad](https://cds.unistra.fr/){target="_blank"} is a good place to start

- [Vera Rubin](https://www.lsst.org/about/dm/data-products){target="_blank"} will be a big deal

- and archives, like the [exoplanet one](https://www.exoplanet.eu/home/){target="_blank"}, or the equivalent from [Nasa](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/data.html){target="_blank"}

## How to get it

- there'll be an API

    + if your code includes access to an API, please put it front and centre
    + makes it easier to adapt when the API changes

- can do something more à la carte

- filter at source

## What's happening in the field

- mountain-top telescopes

- space-based telescopes

- radio-wave arrays

- doing a lot of work in Infra-Red these days

- spectroscopy

- time-domain

## Some key questions

- formation of early universe

- nature of dark matter

- the mysteries of our solar system

- exoplanets

## Exoplanets



::::columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}


- almost 6000 confirmed

    + enough to do statistics
    
    + loads more candidates
    
       - pressing need for follow up studies
       
    + lots being discovered in legacy data

- detect by:

    + transits - they pass in front of their host star making them a little dimmer
    
    + radial velocity - the host star wobbles as the planet orbits, can be picked up by doppler shift in spectum
    
    + note, we never get to directly see the planet

## What do we Know


1. how far from its sun (from orbital period)

1. measure planet size (how much dimming by transit)

1. planet mass (from how much wobble it causes)

    + these last two give us planet density
    
    + can figure out if it's a lump of rock or a ball of gas. And everything in between
    
1. Starting to get spectra of exoplanet atmospheres 


## Surprises

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}

- they are so common, seems like default for a star to have planets

    + weren't expecting this, thought they'd be rare
    
- most systems have close in planets

    + we just have Mercury at 88 days

- planets migrate

    + find planets in orbits where they couldn't possibly have formed
    
    + c.f. hot Jupiters

- beefed up version of Earth is by far most common type

    + nothing like this in our solar system
    
- orbits aren't very circular

- __beads-on-a-string__ mechanism quite common

:::

## Where are they (so far)

![](images/milky-way-exoplanets.jpg)

## What comes next

- exoplanet spectra will be a big deal

    + what gasses are in the atmosphere
    
    + even isotope abundances ($^{13}C / ^{12}C$ and $^{18}O / ^{16}O$)
    
    + look for bio-signatures
    
    + look for techno-signatures
    
## Our Work

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}

- most of the heavy lifting done from space (Kepler, TESS.....)

- need ground based follow-up, or indeed discovery

    + possible with modest telescope
    
- atmosphere is a big problem

    + differential photometry
        
    + if all stars vary simultaneously, it's the atmosphere
    
    + if one blinks on its own, could be interesting
        
    + need good reference stars
    
        - same colour, similar intensity
        
        - our job is identifying fields with hosts of _clone_ stars

## What makes a _clone_?

- ideally stellar spectra should be the same

- for most stars, don't have a spectrum, just (5) colours in different wavelength bands

- need some way to assess suitable with this limited information

- time for some machine learning

   + use stars with the full information
   
   + use them to infer behaviour for stars where we know less
