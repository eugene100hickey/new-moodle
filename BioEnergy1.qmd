## Calorimetry

- Direct: measure heat produced during exercise - Human Calorimetry Chamber

- Indirect: measure O~2~ consumption (VO~2~)
typically about 
0.25mL/kg/s of VO~2~ during exercise
0.05mL/kg/s of VO~2~ during rest


##

- Maximum VO~2~ measured by exercising to exhaustion
get up to 1mL/kg/s

- corresponds to about 2000 Watts of power

- training will increase your VO~2~ max

- cardiovascular adaptations giving better O~2~ delivery

- muscle mitocondrial O~2~ utilisation

- athletes using large muscle masses for extended periods tend to have highest VO~2~ max

---

## Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER)

as well as measuring O~2~ levels we also monitor CO~2~
gives us the RER
$$ RER = \frac{V_{CO_2}}{V_{O_2}} $$
This gives information on type of food being used

- for fats, RER = 0.7

- for glucose, RER = 1.0

---

Fats, e.g. palmitate, 
C~16~H~32~O~2~ + 23 O~2~ -> 16 CO~2~ + 16 H~2~O
$$ \frac{16}{23} = 0.70 $$
Glucose,
C~6~H~12~O~6~ + 6 O~2~ -> 6 CO~2~ + 6 H~2~O
$$ \frac{6}{6} = 1.0 $$
---

## Fuel depends on Type of Exercise


 - for long distance, endurance, RER lets us deduce that mostly fats are burned

 - for high-powered activities like sprinting, mostly carbohydrates

 
## CHO's needed at higher intensities

## Fuel used During a Marathon

- muscle triglycerides: provide ~ 30% of energy initially but fades to ~10%  gradually over four hours

- plasma FFA: provide ~ 20% initially but this grows to 50% over four hours

- blood glucose: provides 10% initially, this grows to 40% after four hours

##  

- muscle glycogen: provides ~ 40% initially but fades out over about 3 hours

- decrease in CHO use leads to a decrease inperformance and to the onset of fatigue

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDG4GSypcIE) for a discussion of energy use in sled dogs.

##  Fuel used During a Marathon


![](img/marathon-glucose.png)



## Crossover Concept

As exercise intensity increases

- progressive **decrease** in **fats** as fuel source

- progressive **increase** in **CHO** as fuel source

Training adaptation - push this crossover point to higher intensities

Leads to sparing of precious CHO stores

Pushes back onset of fatigue

---

## ATP & Muscle Work{.smaller}

Only ATP can be used to directly cause muscle contraction

- Breakdown of ATP allows crossbridge formation between actin and myosin (enzyme ATPase)

- Amount of ATP in muscle is extremely low

- During exercise as ATP utilisation goes up, need to replace it

$$ ATP_{prod} = ATP_{util} $$
ATP producing pathways turns on by the *energy charge* in the cell
$$ Energy\; Charge = \frac{[ATP] + {1\over2} [ADP]}{[ATP] + [ADP] + [AMP]} $$
At rest, the *energy charge* in muscle is about 0.85
As *energy charge* decreases, ATP producing pathways are turned on while ATP utilising pathways are turned off

---

## Mitochondria


Oxidative production of ATP occurs in mitochondria.


This is vast majority of ATP production.


- Aerobic activity
- For exercise lasting minutes or longer
- shorter bouts of exercise use anaerobic pathways for ATP production

---

## Anaerobic Sources of Energy

Activities lasting seconds need energy immediately
Access stores of ATP in the cell

$$ ATP + H_2O\; \rightarrow\;ADP + P_i \qquad ATP_{ase} $$

$$ CP + ADP\; \rightarrow \; ATP + C \qquad creatine\; kinase $$
No $O_2$ in either process

About 3 or 4 times more CP than ATP in cell.

---

## Carbohydrates

Carbohydrate can be broken down anaerobically

$$C_6H_{12}O_6\; \rightarrow\; 2 ATP + 2\; lactate $$
Or aerobically

$$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2\; \rightarrow\; 30ATP + 6CO_2 + 6H_2O$$
(note, for the same glucose molecule we get 15 times more ATP when broken aerobically)
Limited amount of carbohydrate in the body, aerobic metabolism helps preserves carbohydrate stores.

##

Fats can also be broken down aerobically
$$Palmitate + 23O_2\;\rightarrow\;108ATP + 16CO_2$$
---

## Carbohydrate Storage{.smaller}

Carbohydrates stored as *Glycogen*

Glycogen = strings of glucose attached to each other

When glucose needed, peeled off from glycogen

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}


### Muscle Glycogen

- typically 400g = 1600kCal
- this is ~90mM/kg of muscle
- can be depleted in minutes
- carbohydrate loading: supercharges muscles with up to 250mM/kg of muscle
- useful for exercises of > 90 minutes

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Liver Glycogen

- typically 100g = 400kCal
- needed to maintain blood glucose levels


### Blood

- typically 3g = 12kCal (i.e. not very much)

**Total of 2000kCal can be depleted during endurance exercise**
This isn't very much (gets depleted).

:::

::::

---

## Compare to Fat Storage


Adipose Tissue

- typically 12kg = 108,000kCal
- fifty times more energy than carbohydrates
- key aerobic training adaptation is being able to use fat stores
- this preserves carbohydrate stores

---

## To What Extent do we use Carbohydrates?

- __Intensity and duration of exercise__
- at low intensities use fats
- at high intensities use carbohydrates
- at high intensities use mostly type II muscle fibres
- Type of activity
- __Crossover Concept__


- Nutritional status

---

## Different Muscle Fibres

![Muscle Fibres](img/fibres.png)

---

## Getting CHO from Glycogen

- glucose molecule stripped off by glycogen phosphorylase.  

- prompted by release of epinephrine or by Ca<sup>++</sup> in muscle.

- at high exercise intensities, muscle glycogen can drop from 90mM/kg to less 20mM/kg in minutes.

    - using mostly type II muscle fibres
---

## Liver Glycogen

- provides glucose for blood glucose levels

- necessary to avoid exercise induced hypoglycemia

- muscle uptake from blood is up to 50mM/min

- normal liver glucose levels are about 4mM/L (about 5L of blood in human body)

---

## Carbohydrate Loading

- increase CHO content in muscles prior to exercise

- can get up to 250 mM/kg of muscle

- (compare to 90 mM/kg normally)

- increase CHO intake in week prior to exercise

- roughly double it to ~0.6kg/day

- rest for day or so before exercise


---

## Carbohydrate Feeding

- consumption of very dilute CHO drink during exercise

- athletes at 70% VO~2~ max can exercise for ~4 hours rather than 3 hours before fatigue

- gives addition source of CHO thus sparing liver glycogen

---

## Training Adaptations

- sedentary individuals can double their cell mitochondrial content through training

- takes several weeks

- means using more CHO aerobically rather than anaerobically

- as we've seen, this is more more efficient

- spares muscle CHO content

- also observe a lower *__RER__* for individuals after training

- lower RER means greater fat usage

- this happens at all VO~2~ % levels

## Carbohydrate Summary

- exercise intensity and fibre recruitment determine CHO utilisation

- we have limited CHO stores (mostly in muscle)

- liver glycogenolysis maintains blood glucose

- carbohydrate loading increase muscle glucose levels before exercise

- carbohydrate feeding maintains blood glucose during exercise

## Fat Metabolism During Exercise

- free fatty acids are immediate source of energy

- fats must be converted to FFA's before being used

- FFA's are hydrocarbon chains that can readily be oxidised in mitochondria

- FFA's stored in the form of triglycerides

- triglycerides stored in adipose tissue (mostly) or skeletal muscle

## Fat Usage During Exercise

- during prolonged exercise, more energy harvested from adipose fats
    - decrease in use of CHO's and muscular triglycerides
    
- in contrast, as exercise intensity increases, less energy from adipose stores
    - crossover concept
    
- training adaptations for endurance:
    - greater ability to rely on fat energy stores at any exercise intensity
    - greater carbohydrate sparing
    
## Fats Summary

- FFA for direct ATP production

- triglycerides are storage form

- vast bulk of fat storage in adipose tissue ( > 100,000 Cal)

- some fat storage in muscles (~ 3000Cal)

- fats are preferred fuel at low exercise intensities

- training adaptation is better use of fats

## Protein Metabolism

- proteins made from amino acids

- to be used as fuel (contribute ~10%), proteins must be broken down to constituent AA's

- some AA's used directly as fuel, others converted to CHO and fat

- Nitrogen balance - protein intake
    - positive for growing children and intense weight training
    
- typical adult diet ~ 60g protein / day
    - double this for endurance training
    - triple it for strength training
    
## Muscle Protein Synthesis

- decreases during exercise
    - energy charge drops - inhibits synthesis
    
- but significantly increases post exercise
   - increase protein intake 1 hour post exercise
   
# Body Adaptations to Exercise

- Muscular

- Respiratory

- Cardiovascular

- Endocrine

- Immune

## Muscle

- 3 types of muscle
    - cardiac
    - skeletal
    - smooth (e.g. around blood vessels)
    
## Skeletal Muscle

- contractions
    - isometric
    - concentric (most common type)
    - eccentric (main source of muscle soreness after exercise)

:::
  
::::

## Fibre Composition in Athletes

- distance runners
    - 75% Type I
    - 25% Type II
    
- sprinters
    - 25% Type I
    - 75% Type II

- non-athletes
    - 50% Type I
    - 50% Type II

## Respiratory System

- functions
    - manage arterial $O_2$ pressure
    - manage $CO_2$ pressure
    - control pH during exercise
    
## $O_2$

- haemoglobin in red blood cells carry $O_2$
    - increase in red blood cells due to endurance training (also blood doping)

## $CO_2$

- $CO_2$ produced metabolically
    - aerobic break down of CHO, fats, etc

- $CO_2$ also produced non-metabolically
    - buffering of acids

$$H^+ + HCO_3\;\rightarrow\;H_2CO_3\;\rightarrow\;CO_2\; +\;H_2O $$
    - stops muscles and blood getting too acidic
    
## Increase in Respiration during Exercise

- increase tidal volume

- increase breathing rate

- at rest
    - 12 breaths / min $\times$ 0.5 L/breath = 6 L/min

- maximal exercise
    - 48 breaths / min $\times$ 4 L/breath = 192 L/min
    
- most efficient to increase tidal volume

## Control of Respiration

- initially neural control

- later humoral (blood chemistry) control

## Cardiovascular System

- response to exercise
    - heart pumps harder
    - blood vessels to muscles dilate (double blood flow)
    - decrease blood flow to other organs
    
$$Cardiac\;Output\;=\;Heart\;Rate\;\times\;Stroke\;Volume$$


## Heart rate increase  

- reduce parasympathetic nerve activity   
    
- increase sympathetic nerve activity  
    
- increase epinephrine   
    
- heart rate from 40bpm to 180bpm   
    
- stroke volume 100 to 150 mL / beat   

- endurance athletes can get up to 50 L/min (at 5L/min $O_2$ consumption)

## Arteriovenous Oxgen Delivery

- measures efficacy of blood in delivering $O_2$

- get about 6mL of $VO_2$ for every 100mL of blood at rest

- increases to 20mL of $VO_2$ for every 100mL of blood at $VO_2\:max$


## Cardiac Output

- at rest
    - 6 L/min
    - 20% to skeletal muscles
    
- during intense exercise
    - 25 L/min
    - 90% to skeletal muscle
    - dramaticaly decrease % to gut, kidneys, etc
    - maintain flow to brain
    
## Blood Pressure

- systolic blood pressure can double during intense exercise

- diastolic pressure doesn't change much


## Cardiac Training Adaptations

- lower heart rate at rest and at submaximal exercise

- greater stroke volume at rest and submaximal exercise

- greater maximal cardiac output (due to increased stroke volume)

- increased arteriovascular $O_2$ difference
    - increased red blood cells
    - more capillaries in muscle
    - more mitochondria

- maximum heart rate doesn't change

## Endocrine System

- Pancreas
    - release of insulin (glucose uptake from cells)
    - release of glucogon (replenish glucose in blood from liver)

- Adrenal
    - epinephrine and norepinephrine
    
- Pituitary 
    - growth hormone
    
## Endocrine Training Adaptations

- exercise increases bodies insulin sensitivity
    - directly addresses type II diabetes

- epinephrine and norepinephrine increase during exercise
    - regulated by sympathetic nervous system
    - *fight or flight response*
    - increase heart rate, stroke volume, fat mobilisation, glycogen breakdown
    
- growth hormone
    - increase protein synthesis and FFA utilisation
    - slow but large increase in GH post exercise
    
## Immune System

- immune system suppressed for hours post intense exercise
    - reduce both antibodies and T-cells
    - epinephrine and cortisol both immunosuppressants
    
# Training Adaptations

- endurance training

- strength training

## For endurance training

- frequency
    - 3 to 5 times per week
    
- intensity
   - 60% - 80% of cardiac reserve (heart rate)
   
- duration
    - 20 to 60 minutes continuous aerobic
    
- mode
    - large muscle groups
    
## For strength training

- frequency
    - 5 times / week, sometimes split routines

- intensity
    - 70% of one repetition maximum (1-RM)

- no of sets
    - 3 sets

- repetitions
    - 10 per set
    
---
    
- get neural adaptations first, follwed by muscle hypertrophy

- genetics, nutrition, environmental factors all play role

- percentage strenght gain same for men and women
    - though more testosterone in men
    
## Nutritional Requirements - Eudurance

- how much to eat
    - maintain energy balance

- what to eat
    - ~60% CHO (endurance)

---

- when to eat
    - to replenish CHO stores, best within 1-2 hours post exercise
    - increased insulin sensitivity
    - pre competition - 3 hours before, 500 Calories or less, mostly CHO
    
- maintain hydration during exercise
    - plasma volume
    - temperature regulation

## Nutritional Requirements - Strength

- muscle protein synthesis > protein breakdown

- resistance training + high protein diet

- double protein intake to 1.6kg / kg body weight

- ingest protein in first hour post training
   - easily digested proteins (e.g. whey) ideal
   
# Causes of Muscle Fatigue

- causes diverse, but mostly in the muscle

- depends on type of muscle fibre

## Fatigue for Short High Intensity Exercise

- depletion of ATP and PCr

- increased muscle acidity
    - $H^+$ interferes with $Ca^{2+}$'s role in muscle contraction
    - also inhibits anaerobic glycolysis
    - buffering (e.g. $NaHCO_3$)
    
## Fatigue for Endurance Exercise

- decrease in muscle and liver glycogen

- decrease in intra-muscular calcium

- higher body temperature
    - more blood to skin for cooling
    
## Causes of Muscle Soreness

- muscle soreness felt during and immediately after exercise
    - localised pain and burning
    - prolonged isometric contraction
    - muscle tension causes local blood flow to collapse
    - interupts $O_2$ delivery
    - increase reliance on anaerobic production
    - increased acidity
    - activate pain receptors in muscle
    - subsides rapidly after exercise stops
    
---  

- muscle cramps and spasms
   - *electrolyte imbalance caused by dehydration and temperature increase*
   - makes neuromuscular junction more excitable
   - *altered neuromuscular control*
   - motor neuron fires involuntarily
   - strecthing golgi tendon organ inhibits motor neurons
   
---

- muscle stiffness felt 8-48 hours post exercise
    - delayed onset muscle soreness
    - after performing novel type of exercise
    - caused by eccentric muscle contractions
    - fewer fibres recruited for these actions
    - greater force per fibre leads to micro-trauma
    - leads to inflammation and tenderness
    - not due to lactic acid (lactic acid quickly flushed after exercise)
    - dead muscle removed and replaced over days
    
## Performance Enhancing Drugs

- ergogenic techniques
    - anabolic steroids
    
## Strength - Anabolic Steroids

- along with heavy resistance training and high protein diet
   - but without androgenic effects
   
- administered orally and injected
    - stacking and pyramiding
    
- enter nucleus and alter gene expression

---

- serious health consequences
    - cancers
    - psychological effects
    - etc
    
- also growth hormones
- similar chemical structure to testosterone

## Performance Enhancing Drugs - Endurance

- blood doping
    - $O_2$ delivery - endeavours near $VO_2\:max$
    - increase red blood cell concentration and blood volume
    - red blood cell reinfusion
    - high altitude exposure
    - EPO (hormone secreted by the kidneys that promotes red blood cell production in the bone marrow). Can lead to blood clots
    
    
## Caffeine

- greater mental alertness

- greater fat mobilisation

- greater time to exhaustion

- also interacts with $Ca^{2+}$ from SR

# Exercise in Health and Disease

- dieting and weight control

- heart disease

- diabetes

- cancer

- successful aging

- mental health

## Health Dangers

- low fitness

- smoking

- systolic BP > 140mmHg

- Cholesterol > 6.2 mM / L

- BMI > 27

### even low levels of exercise are beneficial

## Diet, Weight Control, and Exercise

- culprit is adipose cells that store fat

- measures of body composition
    - DEXA (gold standard)
    - skin fold calipers along with hip and waist measurements
    - bio-electrical impedance
    - BMI (pretty crude)
    
## Types of Body Fat

- Upper body obesity
    - primarily adominal region
    - greater health risk
    - visceral fat within abdominal cavity surrounding liver, pancreas, intestines, etc
    
- Lower body obesity
    - primalily hips and thighs
    - lower health risk
    - sub-cutaneous
    
## Metabolic Syndrome

- increased risk for
    - heart disease
    - stroke
    - diabetes type II
    
- symptoms such as
    - increased bloop pressure
    - high blood glucose
    - abnormal blood cholesterol levels
    
## Dieting

- dieting alone
    - initial weight loss due to water
    - followed by significant loss of fats
    - *but* also protein, so loss of skeletal muscle
    
- exercise alone
    - number of Calories burned is relatively small
    - but even is weight loss is minimal, health gains can still be significant
    
## Heart Disease

- atherosclerosis
    - deposition of plaques of fat on inner walls of arteries
    
- LDL is major culprit here
    - exercise helps swap HDL for LDL
    
- heart attacks and stroke

- exercise reduces both systolic and diastolic BP
- physical activity addresses many of the risk factors


## Exercise and Diabetes

- type II diabetes linked with obesity (visceral fat)
    - insulin resistance
    - normal blood sugar < 5.5 mM/L
    - prediabetic < 7mM / L
    - diabetic > 7mM / L

---

- symptoms
    - thirst
    - frequent urination
    - fatigue
    - slow healing sores and frequent infection
    - blurred vision
    - loss of peripheral sensation
    
## Cellular Mechanism of Diabetes

- insulin resistance

- insulin receptor in cell wall opens GLUT4 glucose channel

- in diabetes, signal between insulin receptor and glucose channel is compromised

- single bout of exercise reduces blood glucose

- regular exercise increases glucose sensitivity in muscle
    - both for endurance and strength training
    
## Exercise and Cancer

- lower risk of some cancers, and helps treatment

- has shown exercise reduces risk for breast, colon, prostate, ~~lung~~ cancers

- exercise enhances natural immunity

- increase levels of anti-oxidants

- lowers obesity

- retards growth factors implicated in cancer such IGF-1

# Exercise and Aging

- as we've seen, exercise addresses many health issues that arise in aging

- balance, strength, flexibility, endurance

- $VO_2\;max$ declines with age, exercising mitigates this
    - *athletes* 75 mL / kg / min to 45 mL / kg / min at age 75
    - *sedantary* 40 mL / kg / min to 26 mL / kg / min at age 75
    - **and** never too old to start
    
## Sarcopenia

- loss of muscle mass with age
    - can lose %10 per decade

- effects strength, balance, etc
    - also impacts bone density
    
- training adaptations we've discussed before will also occur in older people

## Osteoporosis

- loss of calcium from bones

- bone is similar to muscle in that when overloaded it will adapt and strengthen

- weightlifting especially beneficial

## Exercise and the Brain

- increase cognitive function

- decrease risk of dementia

- decrease risk of Alzheimer's

- decrease risk of Parkinson's

- reduce depression, stress, anxiety

## Healthy Brain

- regular exercise

- healthy diet

- quality sleep

- active social life

- stress management

- mental stimulation

## Brain Activity

- blood flow can increase by up to 20% during exercise
    - mitigates vascular degeneration in the brain

- pretty much all brain areas

- increased blow (and CSF) flow reduces build-up of $\beta$ amyloid plaques (AD)

- exercise promotes dopamine, benefits people with Parkinson's
