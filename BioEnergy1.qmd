## Calorimetry

- Direct: measure heat produced during exercise - Human Calorimetry Chamber

- Indirect: measure O~2~ consumption (VO~2~)
typically about 
0.25mL/kg/s of VO~2~ during exercise
0.05mL/kg/s of VO~2~ during rest


##

- Maximum VO~2~ measured by exercising to exhaustion
get up to 1mL/kg/s

- corresponds to about 250 Watts of power

- training will increase your VO~2~ max

- cardiovascular adaptations giving better O~2~ delivery

- muscle mitocondrial O~2~ utilisation

- athletes using large muscle masses for extended periods tend to have highest VO~2~ max

---

## Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER){.smaller}

as well as measuring O~2~ levels we also monitor CO~2~
gives us the RER
$$ RER = \frac{V_{CO_2}}{V_{O_2}} $$
This gives information on type of food being used

- for fats, RER = 0.7

- for glucose, RER = 1.0

Fats, e.g. palmitate, 
C~16~H~32~O~2~ + 23 O~2~ -> 16 CO~2~ + 16 H~2~O
$$ \frac{16}{23} = 0.70 $$
Glucose,
C~6~H~12~O~6~ + 6 O~2~ -> 6 CO~2~ + 6 H~2~O
$$ \frac{6}{6} = 1.0 $$

## Fuel depends on Type of Exercise


 - for long distance, endurance, RER lets us deduce that mostly fats are burned

 - for high-powered activities like sprinting, mostly carbohydrates

---

## Fuel used During a Marathon

- muscle triglycerides: provide ~ 30% of energy initially but fades to ~10%  gradually over four hours

- plasma FFA: provide ~ 20% initially but this grows to 50% over four hours

- blood glucose: provides 10% initially, this grows to 40% after four hours

##  

- muscle glycogen: provides ~ 40% initially but fades out over about 3 hours

- decrease in CHO use leads to a decrease inperformance and to the onset of fatigue

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDG4GSypcIE) for a discussion of energy use in sled dogs.

##  Fuel used During a Marathon

## Crossover Concept

As exercise intensity increases

- progressive **decrease** in **fats** as fuel source

- progressive **increase** in **CHO** as fuel source

Training adaptation - push this crossover point to higher intensities

Leads to sparing of precious CHO stores

Pushes back onset of fatigue

---

## ATP & Muscle Work{.smaller}

Only ATP can be used to directly cause muscle contraction

- Breakdown of ATP allows crossbridge formation between actin and myosin (enzyme ATPase)

- Amount of ATP in muscle is extremely low

- During exercise as ATP utilisation goes up, need to replace it

$$ ATP_{prod} = ATP_{util} $$
ATP producing pathways turns on by the *energy charge* in the cell
$$ Energy\; Charge = \frac{[ATP] + {1\over2} [ADP]}{[ATP] + [ADP] + [AMP]} $$
At rest, the *energy charge* in muscle is about 0.85
As *energy charge* decreases, ATP producing pathways are turned on while ATP utilising pathways are turned off

---

## Mitochondria


Oxidative production of ATP occurs in mitochondria.


This is vast majority of ATP production.


- Aerobic activity
- Last minutes or longer

---

## Anaerobic Sources of Energy

Activities lasting seconds need energy immediately
Access stores of ATP in the cell

$$ ATP + H_2O\; \rightarrow\;ADP + P_i \qquad ATP_{ase} $$

$$ ATP + H_2O\; \rightarrow\;ADP + P_i \qquad ATP_{ase} $$

$$ CP + ADP\; \rightarrow \; ATP + C \qquad creatine\; kinase $$
No $O_2$ in either process

---

## Carbohydrates

Carbohydrate can be broken down anaerobically

$$C_6H_{12}O_6\; \rightarrow\; 2 ATP + 2\; lactate $$
Or aerobically

$$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2\; \rightarrow\; 30ATP + 6CO_2 + 6H_2O$$
(note, for the same glucose molecule we get 15 times more ATP when broken aerobically)
Limited amount of carbohydrate in the body, aerobic metabolism helps preserves carbohydrate stores.

##

Fats can also be broken down aerobically
$$Palmitate + 23O_2\;\rightarrow\;108ATP + 16CO_2$$
---

## Carbohydrate Storage{.smaller}

Carbohydrates stored as *Glycogen*

Glycogen = strings of glucose attached to each other

When glucose needed, peeled off from glycogen

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}


Muscle Glycogen

- typically 400g = 1600kCal
- this is ~90mM/kg of muscle
- can be depleted in minutes
- carbohydrate loading: supercharges muscles with up to 250mM/kg of muscle
- useful for exercises of > 90 minutes

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Liver Glycogen

- typically 100g = 400kCal
- needed to maintain blood glucose levels


Blood

- typically 3g = 12kCal (i.e. not very much)

Total of 2000kCal can be depleted during endurance exercise

:::

## Compare to Fat Storage


Adipose Tissue

- typically 12kg = 108,000kCal
- fifty times more energy than carbohydrates
- key aerobic training adaptation is being able to use fat stores
- this preserves carbohydrate stores

---

## To What Extent do we use Carbohydrates?

- __Intensity and duration of exercise__
- at low intensities use fats
- at high intensities use carbohydrates
- at high intensities use mostly type II muscle fibres


- Type of activity


- Nutritional status

---

## Different Muscle Fibres

![Muscle Fibres](img/fibres.png)

- Training level

---

## Liver Glycogen

- provides glucose for blood glucose levels

- necessary to avoid exercise induced hypoglycemia

- muscle uptake from blood is up to 50mM/min

---

## Carbohydrate Loading

- increase CHO content in muscles prior to exercise

- can get up to 250 mM/kg of muscle

- (compare to 90 mM/kg normally)

- increase CHO intake in week prior to exercise

- roughly double it to ~0.6kg/day

- rest for day or so before exercise


---

## Carbohydrate Feeding

- consumption of very dilute CHO drink during exercise

- athletes at 70 VO~2~ max can exercise for ~4 hours rather than 3 hours before fatigue

- gives addition source of CHO thus sparing liver glycogen

---

## Training Adaptations

- sedentary individuals can double their cell mitochondrial content through training

- takes several weeks

- means using more CHO aerobically rather than anaerobically

- as we've seen, this is more more efficient

- spares muscle CHO content

- also observe a lower *__RER__* for individuals after training

- lower RER means greater fat usage

- this happens at all VO~2~ % levels
