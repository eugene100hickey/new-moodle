-   making a new university is a complicated journey
-   head of discipline is a key element in that process
-   tentacles to many different players
    -   students
    -   staff of the discipline
    -   other heads of discipline
    -   upper management

## Students

-   answerable to students individually
-   every student is different
    -   qualities
    -   attributes
    -   challenges
-   pastoral role of head of discipline

## Staff

-   staff
    -   technical staff
    -   academics
    -   ancilliary staff
-   need to make resources available
-   need to work as an ensemble
-   need to inspire

## Other Heads of Discipline

-   physics reaches across many domains
    -   undergraduate courses
    -   research groups
-   joint courses - nano
-   pool expertise in our evolving university

## Upper Management

-   need to communicate status and needs of discipline
-   need to implement vision of university

## Visible / Invisible Parts of Function

-   Visible

    -   need to inspire

    -   need to encourage

    -   need to help different elements work together

-   Invisible

    -   resource allocation and planning doesn't *just* happen

    -   but it should seem like it does

## TU Dublin Physics

-   distinct nature of physics

    -   reaches into other disciplines

    -   courses in collaboration with other disciplines

    -   disparate nature of courses

-   would like to grow our student body

-   we have a strong product that we're keen to promote

## Challenges

-   student numbers in physics

-   physics limited to less than 10% who take physics in LC

-   names of courses important

    -   ask secondary school students

    -   back-up for other courses

-   design of website

## What I Can Bring to this Role

-   enthusiastic champion of LMS's

-   embraces change and strives for new standards

## Organisational Skills

-   thorough attention to detail

-   experience in coordinating activities in the School of Applied Science

-   believes in decision making based on information

-   students/staff thrive in atmospheres of clarity and transparence

## Leadership Skills

-   believes in setting high standards

-   metrics that are clear, challenging, and exciting

-   rewarding and encouraging
